奥斯曼帝国是世界历史上最重要的事件之一。
无论你是谁，你的生活都已经被它的存在所塑造。
例如：对香料贸易的控制使得欧洲人得以殖民美洲；
它推翻了东罗马帝国，使俄罗斯成为东正教的中心，在其统治下，巴尔干地区成为一个民族多元化的地区，最终导致了第一次世界大战。
这是一个存在了700年的庞大帝国，控制着北非、中东和东南欧的大部分地区。
它的衰落也是巨大的......而且持续时间很长。
帝国从一股不可阻挡的力量，到世界舞台上与其他国家平起平坐，再到沦为其他国家玩弄的欧洲病夫。
但它是如何崩塌的呢？
好吧，要了解这一点，我们首先需要了解它是如何创建的。
[简介] 帝国的起源可以追溯到 11 世纪迁徙到现代土耳其的游牧突厥部落。
奥斯曼-突厥部落定居于西安纳托利亚，靠近现今的伊斯坦布尔。
到了13世纪，他们成为了蒙古人的附庸国。
随着蒙古人征服越来越多的领土，他们创造了学者、商人和工匠等难民。
一些人逃往奥斯曼帝国。
这为他们提供了坚实的经济基础，使他们能够资助13 世纪的军事行动，征服西安纳托利亚和巴尔干半岛的部分地区。
他们从一个部落变成了一个公国。
这个早期的奥斯曼公国依靠积极参与国家治理的统治者：他们不是在王座上统治，而是在马鞍上统治。
他们会领导军事行动，亲自巡视土地，视察当地局势，人们也可以直接来找他讨论他们遇到的问题。
但随着领土的扩大，参与政府各个方面事务变得越来越困难。
在整个 13 和 14 世纪，奥斯曼人必须寻找新的方式来治理他们的领土。
他们决定效仿周围的政府体制，例如伊朗、伊斯兰和希腊文化。
他们将这些制度结合起来，形成了当时最有效的政府体系之一。
从一个公国变成一个帝国。
到了 15 世纪，奥斯曼帝国取得了巨大的成功，他们成功征服了当时最重要的城市之一君士坦丁堡，并将其作为新的首都。
他们欢迎犹太人和基督徒回到他们征服的土地，并要求他们只因不是穆斯林而缴纳特殊税。
按照当时的标准，奥斯曼帝国是地球上最宽容的居住地之一。
[早期帝国] 但大约在这个时候，帝国也产生了导致其最终灭亡的第一个问题。
因为现在帝国有了首都，苏丹们开始在宫殿里进行统治。
官员、将军或其他重要人物将不再能够接触到它们。
相反，他们会利用后宫。
这是一个由苏丹家族的女性成员、太监、奴隶和妃子组成的政治组织。
苏丹将不再参加重要的政府会议，后宫中的人将控制他所接收的信息。
结果，苏丹周围的人的影响力，特别是他们的母亲和妻子的影响力，就增强了。
早期的苏丹会通过担任总督或指挥官来训练如何统治。
但随着后宫变得越来越重要，这一传统被停止了。
这意味着，与早期的统治者不同，大多数新苏丹没有统治帝国的经验，因此他们高度依赖其他人。
所有这些都使得控制苏丹变得相当容易。
许多母亲会通过操纵儿子来统治帝国。
但这座宫殿也有很多优势。
例如，为了使官僚对帝国保持忠诚，未来的总督、行政人员和将军都在这里接受培训，靠近苏丹和他的宫廷。
这些官僚通常是被带离家、皈依伊斯兰教并被教授行政技能的年轻基督教男孩。
当他们完成训练后，他们将被派往奥斯曼帝国领土，为苏丹和他的帝国服务。
他们年轻时就将自己的生命、财富和特权托付给了苏丹本人，因此比大多数其他国家的官僚更加忠诚。
比如当时世界上大多数地方都是封建社会：国王

The Ottoman Empire was one of the most importantevents in world history.
No matter who you are, your life has beenshaped by its existence.
For example: their control over the spicetrade led Europeans to colonize the Americas;It brought down the Eastern Roman Empire,causing Russia to become the center of OrthodoxChristianity, and under its rule the Balkansbecame an ethnically diverse region that wouldone day result in WW1.It was a colossal empire that existed for700 years, controlling large parts of NorthAfrica, the Middle East, and South-East Europe.
And it’s fall was colossal too… and along one.
The empire went from being an unstoppableforce, to an equal on the world stage, tobecoming the sickman of Europe for other countriesto play around with.
But HOW did it collapse?
Well, to look at that, we first need to lookat how it was created.
[INTRO] The origins of the Empire are foundin nomadic Turkic tribes which migrated tomodern day Turkey, in the 11th century.
The Ottoman-Turkic tribe settled in WesternAnatolia, close to where Istanbul is locatedtoday.
By the 13th century they became tributariesof the Mongols.
As the Mongols conquered more territory, theycreated refugees such as scholars, merchants,and craftspeople.
Some fled to the Ottomans.
And this provided them with a solid economyfrom which they could fund their militarycampaigns in the 13th century, conqueringparts of Western Anatolia and the Balkans.
They turned from a tribe to a principality.
This early Ottoman principality relied onrulers who were actively involved in the governanceof their state: rather than ruling from athrone, they ruled from a saddle.
They would lead military campaigns, move aroundtheir lands to personally inspect what wasgoing on, and people could come to him directlyto discuss issues they were having.
But as their territory expanded, it becamemore difficult to be involved in all aspectsof the government.
And throughout the 13th and 14th centuriesthe Ottomans would have to find new ways ofgoverning their territory.
They decided to copy systems of governmentfrom those around them, such as Iranian, Islamicand Greek cultures.
They combined them to form one of the mostefficient systems of government of its time.
Turning from a principality, into an empire.
By the 15th century the Ottomans became sosuccessful that they managed to conquer thecity of Constantinople, one of the most importantcities at the time, and make THAT their newcapital.
They would welcome Jews and Christians backinto the lands they conquered, requiring themto only pay a special tax for not being muslims.
By the standards of its time, the OttomanEmpire was one of the most tolerant placesto live on Earth.
[EARLY EMPIRE] But around this time the empirealso created the first issue that would leadto its eventual demise.
Because now that the empire had a capital,the sultans began ruling from their palace.
They would no longer be accessible to officials,generals, or other important people.
But rather, they would make use of the ImperialHarem.
This was a political organization consistingof the female members of the sultan’s family,his eunuchs, slaves, and concubines.
The sultans would stop attending importantgovernment meetings and the people in theharem would control what information he received.
As a result, the influence of the people whosurrounded the sultan, particularly theirmothers and wives, increased.
The early sultans would train how to ruleby serving as governors or commanders.
But as the harem became more important, thistradition was stopped.
Meaning that, unlike the early rulers, mostnew sultans had no experience in ruling anempire, making them highly dependent on otherpeople.
And all this made it rather easy to controlthe sultan.
And many of their mothers would rule the empireby manipulating their son.
But the palace also offered many advantages.
For example, to keep bureaucrats loyal tothe empire, future governors, administrators,and generals received their training here,close to the sultan and his court.
These bureaucrats were often young Christianboys taken from their home, converted to islam,and taught adminstrative skills.
When they finished their training they wouldbe sent across Ottoman territory to servethe sultan and his empire.
As young men, they owed their lives, wealth,and privileges to the sultan himself, keepingthem far more loyal than bureaucrats in mostother countries.
For example, most places in the world at thetime were feudal societies: the king ruled

直接统治一小块土地。
其余领土由地方领主统治，地方领主向国王进贡。
这些地方领主也只直接控制一小块土地，各个地方领主向他们的地方领主进贡等等。
在这种制度下，国王不能直接在他们正式统治的领土上征税或制定法律。
如果他们真的试图这样做，那些领主很可能会反叛。
但在奥斯曼帝国，苏丹可以派遣士兵到遥远的领土收税或直接实施法律。
虽然奥斯曼帝国在帝国的许多地方确实有封建领主，但在当时，它是一个高度中央集权的政府，苏丹能够直接统治其领土的大部分地区。
但他们是如何实现这种程度的集中化的呢？
那么，为此我们需要看看奥斯曼军队。
当时大多数军队都是封建征兵制，这意味着如果发生战争，领主会命令一部分农民带上他们能得到的任何武器和盔甲，其中大多数人一生中从未拿过武器，然后与一小群职业战士一起投入战争。
在奥斯曼帝国，他们有禁卫军。
这些是基督教男孩，他们从小就被阉割并被训练成为士兵。
奥斯曼政府为他们提供了武器、训练和盔甲。
这些都是职业士兵，类似于古罗马或当代中国的士兵。
这些士兵可以被派往帝国各地，以维护苏丹的权威。
当奥斯曼人发动战争时，专业的禁卫军可以击败几乎所有农民军队。
因此，到了 16 世纪，禁卫军已被视为欧洲、亚洲和非洲一股不可阻挡的力量。
到 1566 年，征服了所有这些领土。
[缓慢衰落]这是重要的一年，因为此后帝国的征服逐渐停止。
你看，当他们征服新领土时，他们会指派新的官僚来管理它。
因此，如果你是奥斯曼帝国精英的一部分，那么到目前为止，提升社会等级的最好机会就是征服新的土地，然后进行统治。
但如今征服几乎停止了，精英们开始寻找新的方式来增强他们的权力......他们试图在苏丹的宫廷中获得影响力。
毕竟，当你成为最强大的国家时，没有什么比在你的国家获得更大的影响力更大的奖励了。
苏丹和他的大维西尔鼓励了这场内斗。
大维西尔 (Grand Vesir) 基本上是苏丹的得力助手。
他们推断，如果精英阶层相互争斗，他们就不会与苏丹交战，从而在短期内维持稳定。
但这种内斗并没有带来长期的稳定。
随着精英们开始相互竞争，他们对帝国的稳定变得不那么感兴趣了，因为这种稳定不再带来进一步的征服，因此也不再为精英带来更多的权力。
1566 年以后，苏丹越来越多地受到其母亲、妻子和禁卫军的控制，他们都在争夺宫廷权力。
苏丹变成了生育机器，拥有无限数量的女人来生育孩子。
这些苏丹几乎完全依赖后宫，因此没有直接接触现实。
举一个这种内讧的例子：苏丹易卜拉欣在位时间为 1640 年至 1648 年，他的一生都生活在后宫中。
他没有统治经验，因此他的母亲、导师、妻子、首席太监、禁卫军指挥官以及苏丹的得力助手大维齐尔都争相争夺权力和影响力。
大维齐尔希望通过减少帝国的腐败来提高税收，但精英们却通过腐败赚取了大量金钱。
因此，精英们团结在苏丹妻子周围，要求解雇大维齐尔。
最终，禁卫军、各路精英以及苏丹自己的妻子处死了苏丹，并用他们的儿子，一个 6 岁男孩取而代之。
易卜拉欣因其贪婪和无能而被冠以“疯子易卜拉欣”的称号。
这是帝国每隔几十年就会经历的一个周期：由有能力的人来统治帝国并试图减少腐败。
精英们不想失去他们通过腐败获得的金钱和权力。


a small piece of land directly.
The rest of their territory was ruled overby regional lords who paid tribute to theirking.
These regional lords also only controlleda small piece of land directly, with variouslocal lords paying tribute to their regionallords, etc.
Under this system the kings couldn’t levytaxes or impose laws directly on the territorythey officially ruled.
If they did try to do this, those lords wouldlikely rebel.
But in the Ottoman Empire, the sultan couldsend his soldiers to distant parts of theirterritory to collect taxes or impose lawsdirectly.
While the Ottoman Empire did have feudal lordsin many parts of the empire, for its timeit was a highly centralized government withthe sultan able to directly rule over mostparts of his territory.
But how did they achieve this level of centralization?
Well, for this we need to look at the Ottomanarmy.
Most armies at the time were feudal levies,meaning that if there was a war the lordswould order a portion of their peasants tobring whatever weapons and armor they couldget their hands on, most of whom had neverheld a weapon before in their life, and marchthem into war, alongside a small group ofprofessional warriors.
In the Ottoman Empire, they had the janissaries.
These were Christian boys who were castratedand trained from a young age to be soldiers.
They were given weapons, training, and armorfrom the Ottoman government.
These were professional soldiers, similarto those of ancient Rome or contemporary China.
These soldiers could be sent all over theempire to impose the sultan’s authority.
And when the Ottomans went to war, the professionalarmy of janissaries, could defeat almost anyarmy of peasant farmers.
As a result, the janissaries were seen asan unstoppable force in Europe, Asia, andAfrica by the 16h century.
Conquering all of this territory by 1566.[SLOW DECLINE] And this was an important year,because after this the empire’s conquestscame to a gradual halt.
You see, when they conquered new territory,they assigned new bureaucrats to manage it.
So if you were part of the Ottoman elites,the best chance you had of moving up the socialhierarchy up until this point was to conquernew lands, that you might then govern.
But now that conquests nearly stopped, theelites looked for new ways to increase theirpower…And they did so by trying to gain influencein the sultan’s court.
Afterall, when you are the most powerful country,there is no greater prize than gaining moreinfluence in your country.
This infighting was encouraged by the sultanand his grand vesir.
The grand vesir who was basically the sultan’sright hand man.
And they reasoned that if the elites werefighting amongst each other, they wouldn’tbe fighting the sultan, thus maintaining stabilityin the short term.
But this infighting didn’t create stabilityin the long term.
As the elites began competing against eachother, they became less interested in thestability of the empire, because that stabilityno longer resulted in further conquests andso no longer resulted in more power for theelites.
And after 1566 sultans would be more and morecontrolled by their mothers, wives, and janissarycorps who were all vying for power at court.
The sultan was transformed into a breedingmachine, with an unlimited amount of womento produce children.
These sultans relied almost entirely on theharem and as a result, had no direct contactwith reality.
To give an example of such infighting: SultanIbrahim ruled from 1640-1648 and had livedhis entire life in the harem.
He had no experience in ruling and so hismother, tutor, wife, chief eunuch, janissarycommander, and the sultan’s right hand man,the grand vezir, all vied for power and influence.
The grand vezir wanted to improve taxationby reducing corruption in the empire, butthe elites earned a lot of money from beingcorrupt.
And so the elites rallied around the sultan’swife to have the grand vezir fired.
Eventually the janissaries, various elites,and his own wife had the sultan executed andreplaced with their son, a 6-year old boy.
Ibrahim received the title ‘Ibrahim theMad’ for his greed and incompetence.
And this is a cycle the empire went throughevery couple of decades: someone competentwould rule the empire and try to reduce corruption.
The elites didn’t want to lose their moneyand power which they got through said corruption.

因此，他们会撤掉有能力的人，并用无能的人取而代之，以便继续腐败。
因此，帝国会在几年内努力改善自身，然后停滞几十年。
[欧洲和伊朗超越奥斯曼帝国] 但是，奥斯曼帝国对自己的优势充满信心，而欧洲却对自己的劣势充满信心。
直到 17 世纪，奥斯曼人几乎在每场战争中都击败了他们。
意识到欧洲人的巨大劣势后，他们开始改善自己的国家：他们集中自己的政府，建立专业军队，创造新技术。
其中一项技术就是改进造船业。
你看，欧洲人有一个问题：他们的食物很淡。
因此，几千年来，欧洲人通过中东的贸易路线从东亚购买香料。
但到了 15 世纪，所有这些贸易路线都归奥斯曼帝国所有。
他们对香料贸易征收很高的税来赚钱。
毕竟，欧洲菜太乏味了，他们几乎可以随意定价。
那么，欧洲人将如何应对呢？
环游非洲？
所以无论如何，欧洲人航行到非洲各地是为了逃避奥斯曼帝国的税收。
即使是一艘装满香料的小船也可以轻松支付他们的开支。
随后，欧洲人试图穿越大西洋直接前往亚洲，但却偶然发现了美洲……一些国家立即开始征服它。
欧洲人在亚洲、非洲和美洲建立了殖民地。
当奥斯曼人陷入内讧时，欧洲人就必须与其他欧洲帝国竞争以求生存。
他们承受不起这样的内讧。
就这样，欧洲花了两个世纪的时间缓慢前进，直到17世纪，其实力才与奥斯曼帝国相当。
帝国的另一边是伊朗。
就像欧洲一样，他们也无法抵抗强大的奥斯曼军队。
几个世纪以来，他们一直依靠香料贸易获取收入。
但当奥斯曼人提高税收时，香料贸易就减少了。
后来有一天，欧洲人出现了，想要购买香料。
到 16 世纪末，伊朗海岸线上遍布港口，欢迎来自欧洲和亚洲的香料商人来此再次赚取金钱。
利用这些资金，伊朗可以组建一支以奥斯曼帝国禁卫军为基础、由欧洲军官训练、配备最新型枪支的专业军队。
到了 16 世纪 70 年代和 90 年代，伊朗击败了奥斯曼帝国并占领了部分领土，这是几个世纪以来其他帝国都无法做到的。
然而，奥斯曼人忽视了这些进步。
他们仍然相信自己的优越性。
毕竟，他们几个世纪以来一直打败欧洲人和伊朗人。
他们为什么要采用那些他们仍然认为低人一等的人的做法呢？
但这种心态意味着直到 19世纪，随着世界其他国家的进步，奥斯曼帝国才会慢慢落后。
尽管确实取得了一些进步，但他们陷入了这样的循环：有能力的统治者对腐败的精英构成威胁，而腐败的精英又用能力较弱的统治者取代统治者，以维持给这些精英带来财富的腐败。
[奥斯曼帝国失败] 现在是17 世纪末：伊朗和欧洲已经赶上奥斯曼帝国，甚至在某些方面超越了它，而奥斯曼帝国则忙于内斗，停滞不前。
但现在欧洲已经赶上了他们，他们必须应对欧洲地缘政治的一个独特怪癖：欧洲政治围绕着建立权力平衡而展开，没有一个国家过于强大。
一旦一个国家威胁变得过于强大，欧洲其他国家就会联合起来对付它，因为它们担心欧洲会被这个强国所主宰。
从法国到德国，再到苏联，欧洲人倾向于结成联盟来对抗其中最强大的国家。
1683 年，奥斯曼帝国决定征服维也纳，这座具有重要战略意义的城市将使奥斯曼帝国得以征服中欧。


And so they would remove the competent peopleand replace them with incompetent people sothat they could keep being corrupt.
And so the empire would try to improve itselffor a few years, followed by stagnation fora few decades.
[EUROPE AND IRAN SURPASS OTTOMANS] But whilethe Ottomans were confident in their superiority,Europe was confident in their inferiority.
The Ottomans had defeated them in almost everysingle war they had fought up until the 17thcentury.
Realizing the massive disadvantage of theEuropeans, they began to improve their owncountries: they centralized their own governments,created professional armies, created new technologies.
One such technology was improved shipbuilding.
You see, Europeans had a problem: their foodwas bland.
So for 1000s of years Europeans bought spicesfrom East Asia, with trade routes going throughthe middle east.
But by the 15th century all these trade routeswere owned by the Ottomans.
And they put very high taxes on the spicetrade to make money.
Afterall, European cuisine was so bland theycould ask almost any price they wanted.
And hey, what were the Europeans going todo about it?
Sail around Africa?
So anyway, then Europeans sailed around Africa,in order to avoid Ottomans taxes.
Even a small boat filled with spices couldeasily cover their expenses.
Then Europeans tried crossing the AtlanticOcean to go to Asia directly, but insteadstumbled upon the americas…Which some countries immediately began conquering.
European colonies were established acrossAsia, Africa, and the Americas.
And where the Ottomans turned towards infighting,the Europeans had to compete with other EuropeanEmpires for their own survival.
They couldn’t afford such infighting.
And so Europe spent 2 centuries slowly advancinguntil their power became equal to that ofthe Ottomans by the 17th century.
On the other side of the empire was Iran.
Justlike Europe, they too could not stand up againstthe mighty Ottoman armies.
For centuries they had relied on the spicetrade for income.
But when the Ottomans raised taxes, the spicetrade decreased.
Then one day Europeans showed up looking tobuy spices.
By the end of the 16th century ports litteredthe Iranian shoreline, welcoming spice tradersfrom Europe and Asia in order to earn moneyagain.
With that money Iran could pay for its ownprofessional army based on the Ottoman janissaries,trained by Europeans officers, and armed withthe latest firearms.
By the 1570s and 90s, Iran was able to defeatthe Ottoman Empire and conquer some territoryfrom them, something no other empire was ableto do for centuries.
The Ottomans, however, ignored these advances.
They still believed in their own superiority.
Afterall, they had defeated the Europeansand Iranians for centuries.
Why should they adopt the ways of those whomthey still considered inferior?
But, this mindset meant that until the 19thcentury the Ottoman Empire would slowly beleft behind as the rest of the world advanced.
And while some advances were indeed made,they were trapped in the cycle of competentrulers posing a threat to corrupt elites,who in turn had that ruler replaced with someoneless competent, in order to maintain the corruptionthat gave those elites their wealth.
[OTTOMAN DEFEATS] So by now it’s the late17th century: Iran and Europe were caughtup with the Ottoman and even surpassed itin a couple of ways, while the Empire wasbusy infighting and stagnating.
But now that Europe had caught up with them,they had to deal with a unique quirk in Europeangeopolitics: European politics revolves aroundcreating a balance of power, where no onecountry is ever too powerful.
As soon as a country threatens to become toopowerful, the rest of Europe gangs up on themout of fear that Europe will be dominatedby that one power.
From France to Germany, to the Soviet Union,Europeans tend to form alliances against themost powerful among them.
And in 1683 the Ottoman Empire decided itwanted to conquer Vienna, a strategicallyimportant city that would allow the Ottomansto conquer central Europe.

但欧洲国家联盟成功击退了奥斯曼帝国，并最终夺取了他们的领土。
帝国在这场战争中遭遇了多次失败，最终于1699年签署了和平条约。
这标志着奥斯曼帝国的新时代，它不再是欧洲的主导力量。
而且由于奥斯曼帝国不再被视为不可阻挡的力量，欧洲各大国一有机会就会联合起来攻击奥斯曼帝国。
这将使帝国耗费大量金钱，而收益却微乎其微。
随着世界其他地区的进步，反抗奥斯曼帝国变得越来越容易，每个人都可以试图从他们手中夺取一块领土。
事实上，战争太多了，最终为我研究这个问题的人只是简单地写下“这段时间发生了许多战争”。
这应该给奥斯曼人敲响警钟：他们不再是曾经的超级大国，如果他们想跟上世界其他国家的步伐，他们也必须实现现代化。
战后他们也做出了一些尝试：降低消费品税、收集欧洲最新技术的信息、对海军进行现代化改造、缩减禁卫军规模以降低成本、减少腐败，并参与欧洲政治以避免更多战争。
这些努力或许已经成功了……但军队并不想减少士兵，精英们也不想杜绝腐败。
因此，像往常一样，这两个团体密谋用能力较差的人取代大维齐尔。
再次现代化几年，并在几十年内基本停滞不前。
[帝国崩溃] 奥斯曼帝国遭受的下一次重大打击发生在 1774 年，当时它在与俄罗斯的战争中失败。
奥斯曼帝国被迫签署了另一项屈辱的和平条约，其中向俄罗斯支付了一大笔钱，移交了克里米亚，并给予奥斯曼帝国境内所有东正教基督徒俄罗斯的保护。
这意味着，如果居住在帝国的东正教徒受到奥斯曼帝国的虐待，他们可以向俄罗斯寻求帮助。
然后，俄罗斯将被允许攻击奥斯曼帝国，以确保他们的福祉。
这次失败是如此重大，以至于帝国内的各个省都对自己的政府失去了信心。
帝国能够防止大规模叛乱的唯一方法就是赋予其外围省份更多的自治权。
具体来说，他们将不再直接向这些地区征税，而是允许地方当局向自己的省份征税，然后将其中一部分税款汇往伊斯坦布尔。
从本质上来说，帝国的中央集权正在减弱，封建主义正在增强。
这些地方当局随着时间的推移会发展成为自己的强大王朝。
例如埃及的马穆鲁克，他们会慢慢地让埃及变得越来越独立。
在成为大英帝国的一部分后，马穆鲁克政权在埃及的统治于19 世纪初终结。
然而，他们的遗产却延续了下来，因为埃及一直保持半独立状态，直到 1922 年宣布独立，并在1956 年苏伊士危机期间赶走了最后一批欧洲军队。
成为非洲殖民最少、最成功的国家之一。
另一个主要的例子是沙特家族，他们在该体系下获得了更大的影响力，并最终于 1932 年建立了自己的国家，名为：沙特阿拉伯。
然而，这次对俄罗斯的失败却被这位大瓦西里国王视为帝国急需改革的一个例子。
但是土耳其禁卫军不愿意实现现代化……所以政府干脆决定建立第二军，由来自欧洲的军官训练，配备最新的武器，并进行现代化的战斗训练。
但拥有两支军队的成本非常高昂，很快奥斯曼帝国的精英们就与禁卫军联合起来，于 1807 年发动叛乱，推翻了苏丹和他的新军队。
与此同时，奥斯曼帝国面临着一个新问题：民族主义。
你看，几个世纪以来，奥斯曼帝国一直根据宗教将其人民划分为：穆斯林、基督教徒、犹太教、非亚伯拉罕宗教等。
但法国大革命创造了一种新的身份：民族身份。
在法国大革命之前，一个国家因为拥有共同的民族遗产而统一的想法几乎闻所未闻。
但由于奥斯曼人只关注宗教，他们没有注意到大批民族正在创造自己的民族认同。


But here a coalition of European states managedto beat back the Ottomans and eventually evenconquer territory from them.
The empire faced many defeats in this warand eventually signed a peace treaty in 1699.This marked a new era for the Ottoman stateas it ceased to be the dominant power in Europe.
And because the Ottoman Empire was no longerseen as an unstoppable force, various Europeanpowers would repeatedly gang up on the OttomanEmpire whenever the opportunity would arise.
This would cost the empire a lot of moneywhile gaining very little in the process.
And as the rest of the world advanced, itmeant that it became easier and easier tostand up to the Ottomans and for everybodyto try to take a piece of territory from them.
In fact, there were SO MANY wars that eventuallythe person researching this for me simplywrote down “a bunch of wars happened aroundthis time”.
This should have been a wakeup call for theOttomans: they were no longer the superpowerthey once were and if they wanted to keepup with the rest of the world, they wouldhave to modernize as well.
And some attempts were made after the war:they lowered taxes on consumer goods, gatheredinformation on the latest European technologies,modernized the navy, reduced the size of thejanissaries to reduce its cost, reduced corruption,and became involved in European politics inorder to avoid more wars.
And these efforts might have been successful…except that the army didn’t want fewer soldiersand the elites didn’t want to end corruption.
And so, as usual, these 2 groups conspiredto replace the grand vezir with someone lesscompetent.
Once again modernizing for a few years andlargely stagnating for a few decades.
[EMPIRE CRUMBLES] The next major blow to theOttoman Empire came in 1774, when it losta war against Russia.
The Ottomans were forced to sign yet anotherhumiliating peace treaty in which it paida large sum of money to the Russian state,handed over Crimea, and gave all the Orthodoxchristians living in the Ottoman Empire Russianprotection.
This meant that if an Orthodox Christian livingin the empire was being mistreated by theOttomans, they could ask Russia for help.
Russia would then be allowed to attack theOttomans in order to assure their wellbeing.
This defeat was such an important defeat thatvarious provinces within the empire lost faithin their own government.
And the only way the empire was able to preventmass rebellion was to give more autonomy toits outer provinces.
In particular, they would no longer directlytax these regions but instead allowed localauthorities to tax their own provinces andthen send a portion of that money to Istanbul.
In essence, the empire was becoming less centralizedand more fuedal.
These local authorities would, over time,turn into powerful dynasties of their own.
Such as the Mamluks in Egypt, who would slowlymake Egypt more and more independent.
After they became part of the British Empire,the mamluk power came to an end in Egypt inthe early 19th century.
Yet their legacy endured as Egypt would remainsemi-independent until declaring independencein 1922 and kicking out the last of the Europeantroops during the Suez Crisis in 1956.Becoming one of the least colonized and mostsuccessful countries in Africa.
Another major example was the Saud family,which gained more influence under this systemand would eventually create their own countryin 1932 called: Saudi Arabia.
This defeat against Russia, however, wouldbe used by the grand vasir as an example whythe empire was in drastic need of reform.
But the janissaries were unwilling to modernize…so the government simply decided to createa 2nd army, trained by officers from Europe,with the latest weapons, and modern combattraining.
But having 2 armies was very expensive andsoon the Ottoman elites joined with the janissariesto get rid of the sultan and his new army,with a rebellion in 1807.At the same time, the Ottomans were facinga new problem: nationalism.
You see, the Ottomans had for centuries dividedtheir people up based on religion: muslims,Christians, Jewish, Non-Abrahamic religions,etc..
But the French revolution created a new typeof identity: a national identity.
The idea that a country was united due toa shared national heritage was almost unheardof before the French Revolution.
But because the Ottomans only looked at religion,they did not notice that large groups of peopleswere creating their own national identities.

这些新身份很大程度上是基于对奥斯曼帝国统治者的共同仇恨：罗马尼亚人、希腊人和塞尔维亚人。
作为一个只注重宗教认同的多民族国家，奥斯曼帝国对民族革命完全没有准备。
第一次革命发生在塞尔维亚，帝国给予新塞尔维亚公国自治权以换取进贡，并允许奥斯曼帝国在塞尔维亚驻军。
1815年，希腊也加入进来，并在欧洲主要列强的帮助下建立了现代希腊国家。
这给帝国的精英们带来了问题。
你看，所有曾经在塞尔维亚和希腊工作的官僚现在都失业了。
突然间，许多精英意识到帝国下一个脱离的部分可能就是他们控制的地区。
现在他们可以把战争失败归咎于禁卫军。
因此，奥斯曼政府中终于有足够多的人希望看到变革。
但仍然存在一个主要障碍：禁卫军。
为了安抚他们，中央政府决定不再建立整个第二军，而是先对一小部分军队进行现代化改造。
尤其是炮兵部队。
几年后，苏丹要求所有禁卫军都采用现代欧洲的作战方式。
但和往常一样，禁卫军拒绝了。
但这一次，他们不能指望精英阶层的支持。
苏丹意识到，如果帝国不尽快改革，它将慢慢被欧洲帝国所取代，就像美洲和当时亚洲所发生的那样。
因此，他做出了改革的最大反对者——禁卫军所做出的决定。
是。
已移除！
否则他们都会失败。
于是，1826 年 6 月 15 日半夜，苏丹命令他的炮兵部队瞄准土耳其禁卫军营房，趁他们睡觉时发射炮弹。
效忠苏丹的士兵们进军杀死了他们遇到的每一个禁卫军。
胜利是彻底的，现代化的最大障碍之一在一天之内就被摧毁了。
第二天，禁卫军正式被废除。
禁卫军未能采用现代武器，导致禁卫军被现代武器摧毁。
[正在进行的改革] 最后，政府的几乎每个方面都实施了改革。
但特别的是，帝国严厉打击了腐败。
例如，当一个人被放逐或被判处死刑时，当地统治者将继承其所有财富。
但那些地方统治者也是决定处决谁、放逐谁的人。
这意味着，作为地方统治者，为了赚取最多的钱，你必须杀死一些最富有和最有能力的人，从而损害整个帝国。
这被定为非法：现在需要一名法官来决定此类惩罚，而地方统治者不能再继承他们的财富。
苏丹不再将自己封闭在后宫，而是积极参与王国的治理。
人民不再被腐败官员敲诈勒索；
他们唯一需要向政府缴纳的钱就是向中央政府缴纳的税。
沒有其他。
各种办公室被关闭，官员的薪水增加，这样他们就有足够的钱来维持他们的生活方式，这些官员不再在宫廷接受培训，而是在专门的机构接受培训，在欧洲各国首都设立常驻大使馆，印刷报纸，翻译办公室将用自己的语言出版最新的技术进展，等等。
1839 年苏丹去世后，一个新的官僚阶层掌权。
在欧洲大使馆积累了经验、了解了欧洲理想并重视法治的人。
随着新苏丹的到来，官僚们希望继续改革。
帝国现在拥有一批精英，他们想要继续实现国家现代化。
特别是，政府宣布他们将负责该国的经济管理，类似于欧洲其他国家的政府。


And these new identities were in large partbased on a common hatred for their Ottomanoverlords: Romanians, Greeks, and Serbs.
As a multi-ethnic state that looked only atreligious identity, the Ottomans were completelyunprepared for national revolutions.
The first of these revolutions was in Serbia,resulting in the empire giving the new SerbianPrincipality autonomy in exchange for payingtribute and allowed the Ottomans to stationtroops in Serbia.
This was followed by Greece in 1815, resultingin the creation of the modern Greek statewith the help of major European powers.
And this caused a problem for the elites ofthe empire.
You see, all the bureaucrats that used towork in Serbia and Greece were now unemployed.
All of a sudden many of the elites realizedthat the next part of the empire to breakaway might be the region they control.
And they could now point towards the janissariesfor losing wars.
And so FINALLY there were enough people inthe Ottoman government who wanted to see change.
But there was still one major obstacle: thejanissaries.
To placate them the central government decidedthat instead of creating a whole second army,they would start by modernizing a small partof the army.
In particular, the artillery corps.
After a few years, the sultan demanded thatthe janissaries as a whole were to adopt themodern European style of warfare.
But as usual, the janissaries refused.
But this time, they couldn’t count on theelites to support them.
The sultan realized that if the empire didn’treform soon, it would slowly be taken overby European empires, as had happened in theAmericas and was happening at the time inAsia.
And so he made the decision that the janissaries,the largest opposition against reform, had.
To be.
Removed!
Or else they would all lose.
And so, in the middle of the night on 15 June1826 the sultan ordered his artillery unitsto target the janissary barracks, rainingdown cannon balls while they were asleep.
Soldiers loyal to the sultan moved in to killevery last janissary they encountered.
The victory was complete and in a single dayone of the largest obstacles to modernisationwas destroyed.
The next day the janissary corps was officiallyabolished.
The failure of the janissaries to adopt modernweapons, caused the janissaries to be destroyedby modern weapons.
[REFORMS BEING] Finally, reforms were implementedin almost every aspect of the government.
But in particular, the empire clamped downon corruption.
For example, when a person was banished orsentenced to death, the local ruler wouldinherit all their wealth.
But those local rulers were also the oneswho decided who to execute and who to banish.
Meaning that in order to make the most moneyas a local ruler, you had to kill some ofthe richest and most competent people, harmingthe empire as a whole.
This was made illegal: you now needed a judgeto decide on such punishments and the localrulers could no longer inherit their wealth.
The sultan would no longer seclude himselfin the harem, instead taking active part intheir governance of their realm.
People were no longer allowed to be extortedby corrupt officials; the only money theyhad to pay the government was a tax to thecentral government.
Nothing else.
Various offices were closed, salaries forofficials were increased so they had enoughmoney that they wouldn’t have to extortpeople to keep up their lifestyle, those officialswould no longer be trained in the palace butin specialized institutions, permanent embassieswere set up in European capitals, newspaperswere printed, translation offices would publishthe latest advances in technology in theirown language, and much more.
When the sultan died in 1839, a new classof bureaucrats were in power.
One who gained experience in European embassies,who read about European ideals, and who valuedthe rule of law.
With a new sultan, the bureaucrats wantedto continue the reforms.
The empire now had an elite who wanted tokeep modernizing their state.
In particular, the government declared thatthey would take responsibility for the economicmanagement of the country, similar to therest of the European government.

修建铁路、创办学校、创建大公司，实现工业化。
结果，政府变得更加集中，官僚数量增加了5倍。
政府特别希望维护帝国的统一。
它利用电报系统在几分钟内向伊斯坦布尔通报叛乱情况，并利用铁路在几天内派遣军队恢复控制。
[外国解散奥斯曼帝国] 但是，当帝国进行一些急需的自我照顾时，其他人会试图利用他们：俄罗斯利用其作为奥斯曼帝国东正教基督徒保护者的头衔，在 19 世纪 50 年代的克里米亚战争中占领了巴尔干半岛。
奥斯曼帝国在英国、法国和撒丁岛的支持下赢得了这场战争，然而也付出了巨大的代价。
由于钱太多，奥斯曼帝国欠下了欧洲银行的巨额债务。
他们不得不花费大量金钱来偿还债务，因此需要借更多的钱来支付政府开支。
从本质上来说，帝国变得依赖欧洲列强。
最重要的是，这意味着那些欧洲强国可以相对轻松地从奥斯曼帝国夺取领土。
1939 年英国占领了也门，1860 年黎巴嫩爆发叛乱，导致欧洲帝国派遣军队前往“维持和平”，实际上是将欧洲军队驻扎在奥斯曼帝国中心地带的旁边。
19 世纪 70 年代，在其他欧洲列强的支持下，巴尔干地区爆发了民族主义叛乱，导致保加利亚、塞尔维亚、罗马尼亚和黑山于 1878 年独立，俄罗斯占领了安纳托利亚东部的几个地区，奥匈帝国占领了波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那，英国占领了塞浦路斯。
1881年突尼斯被法国占领，1882年埃及被英国占领。
1885年东鲁米利亚发生革命，并入保加利亚。
尽管遭受军事灾难和领土损失，19 世纪末仍是一个社会、经济和文化发生重大变革的时期。
它排干了西里西亚的一片沼泽，将其变成了棉花种植园，他们生产更多的橄榄、丝绸和许多其他原材料……然而他们生产的制成品却很少。
要成为一个完全工业化的国家，他们需要最新的欧洲技术。
但他们怎样才能让其他公司在他们的帝国里做生意呢？
他们达成了一项协议，作为交换，外国公司将建立现代化工业，帝国将获得低息贷款，而这些公司则无需缴纳任何税款。
因此，他们非但没有从工业化中赚钱，反而借了更多的钱……导致了很多财务问题。
在经济增长的同时，政府收入的13%却被用在偿还贷款上。
因此，帝国需要寻找新的收入来源，他们通过建立自己的大公司（例如Régie 公司）来实现这一目标。
它被赋予了烟草生产和贸易的垄断权。
结果，帝国赚了很多钱，而小烟农却不得不迁移到其他国家种植烟草，烟草价格上涨，进而引发骚乱和抗议，因此该公司的私人武装为了保持对烟草的垄断，杀死了2万多人。
尽管帝国对欧洲列强的债务越来越多，但他们的状况仍然比当时大多数其他国家要好。
突尼斯、埃及的高额债务导致欧洲列强干脆入侵、殖民这些国家。
要了解这最终会导致什么结果，请观看我的“非洲非殖民化”视频。
有人认为，至少奥斯曼帝国不是欧洲的殖民地。
如果你曾经想过为什么这么多国家在脱离殖民统治、转向社会主义之后拒绝西方公司在其国家开展业务；
奥斯曼帝国这样的案例让他们害怕与西方国家做生意。
担心这会是欧洲再次控制他们国家的开始。
[青年土耳其党] 到了 19 世纪末，奥斯曼帝国政府变得专制。
由于担心更多地区发生叛乱，他们建立了间谍和审查网络。
结果，许多异见人士移居国外，在那里讨论他们与帝国之间的问题，他们自称为青年土耳其党人。


Building railroads, setting up schools, andcreating large companies to industrialize.
As a result, the government became more centralized,with the number of bureaucrats growing 5 timesas large.
The government particularly wanted to keepthe empire together.
It did so with a telegraph system that couldinform Istanbul about a rebellion in justa few minutes and with a railroad that couldsend troops to restore control in a few days.
[FOREING DISMANTLING OF THE OTTOMANS] Butwhile the empire was performing some much-neededselfcare, others would try to take advantageof them: Russia used their title as protectorof Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empireto take over the Balkans in the Crimean Warin the 1850s.
The Ottomans won this war with the supportof Great Britain, France, and Sardinia, however,cost them a lot of money.
So much money that the Ottomans became deeplyindebted to European banks.
They had to spend so much money on repayingtheir debt that they needed to borrow moremoney to cover their government expenses.
In essence, the empire became reliant on Europeanpowers.
This, on top of everything else, meant thatthose European powers could relatively easilytake territory away from the Ottomans.
In 1939 the British took Yemen, in 1860 arebellion in Lebanon caused European empiresto send troops there to ‘keep the peace’,in essence stationing European troops rightnext to the Ottoman heartland.
Nationalist rebellions popped up in the Balkansin the 1870s, supported by various other Europeanpowers, causing Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania,and Montenegro to become independent in 1878with Russia taking a few districts in EasternAnatolia, Austria-Hungary taking Bosnia-Herzegovina,and the British taking Cyprus.
Tunisia was taken over by France in 1881 andEgypt was taken over by the British in 1882.In 1885 East Rumelia had a revolution andjoined Bulgaria.
Yet despite the military disasters and territoriallosses, the late 19th century was a periodof significant social, economic, and culturaltransformation.
It drained a swamp in Cilicia to turn it intoa cotton plantation, they produce more olives,silk, and many other raw materials…Yet they produced very little manufacturedgoods.
To become a fully industrialized state, theywould need the latest European technology.
But how were they going to get companies todo business in their empire?
Well, they made a deal, in exchange for foreigncompanies setting up modern industries andthe empire receiving cheap loans, these companieswouldn’t have to pay any taxes.
So instead of earning money from industrialization,they instead got to borrow more money…Causing a lot of financial problems.
While the economy grew, 13% of governmentincome was spent on replaying loans.
As a result, the empire needed to find newsources of income and they did so by settingup their own large companies, such as theRégie Company.
It was given a monopoly on the productionand trade of tobacco.
As a result, the empire earned a lot of moneywhile small tobacco farmers had to move toother countries to grow their crop, the priceof tobacco rose, which in turn resulted inriots and protests, and so the company’sprivate militia killed more than 20 thousandspeople in order to keep their monopoly ontobacco.
And while the empire became more and moreindebted to European powers, they were stillbetter off than most other countries at thetime.
The high debt in Tunisia and Egypt causedthe European powers to simply invade and colonizethese countries.
To see where this eventually leads, see myAfrican Decolonisation video.
It was argued that least the Ottomans weren’ta European colony.
If you’ve ever wondered why so many countriesrefused to let western companies do businessin their country after they decolonised andturn towards socialism; it’s cases likethe Ottoman Empire that made them afraid thatdoing business with Western countries.
Afraid it would be the beginning of Europeancontrol over their country all over again.
[YOUNG TURKS] By the late 19th century theOttoman government had become repressive.
Afraid that more regions would rebel, theyinstituted a network of spies and censorship.
As a result, many dissidents moved abroadwhere they would discuss the issues they hadwith the empire, calling themselves the YoungTurks.

这些群体截然不同，有着不同的想法，有些人想废除君主制，有些人想要不同的君主，而其他人则是无政府主义者。
但他们都有一个共同点：他们都想除掉现任苏丹。
但他们都没有足够的力量将自己的想法在自己的祖国付诸实践。
1905 年俄国革命爆发，这种情况发生了改变。
首先，它被日本击败，50年前，日本还被认为是原始国家，但现在却可以与强大的俄罗斯帝国抗衡。
随后，俄罗斯皇帝被迫接受宪法。
与此同时，伊朗人也于1906年成功迫使政府颁布宪法，并于1911年推翻了王室。
而意大利和德国等国家则成功将其人民统一为强大的国家。
如果他们能做到……为什么奥斯曼人做不到呢？
因此，1908 年青年土耳其党革命成功夺取了政府。
他们的目标是创建一个以伊斯兰教为基础的新民族认同。
你看，随着失去大部分欧洲领土，帝国中的穆斯林比例增加了。
许多穆斯林指责基督徒站在西方列强一边，宣布独立，导致帝国衰落。
年轻的土耳其人希望利用这种怨恨情绪来创建一个共同的伊斯兰民族认同，以反对西方帝国主义。
同样，爱尔兰民族认同是在反对英国的过程中产生的，印度民族认同也是在反对英国的过程中产生的，美国民族认同的根源也是在反对英国的过程中产生的。
他们希望通过建立一个所有人都平等的奥斯曼帝国来防止国家解体。
但青年土耳其党人无法就如何实现这一目标达成一致：他们是否应该将权力集中在伊斯坦布尔？
他们应该成为一个类似美国的联邦吗？
他们是否应该请求外国帮助他们实现目标？
这些分歧导致了1909 年的反革命，最终阿尔巴尼亚宣布独立。
这向帝国内部的许多人表明，即使是青年土耳其党人和他们的信仰也无法阻止帝国的进一步瓦解。
这一软弱时刻导致塞尔维亚、保加利亚、希腊和黑山（这些国家都曾是奥斯曼帝国的一部分）向奥斯曼帝国宣战。
到那场战争结束时，奥斯曼帝国在欧洲几乎已没有留下任何领土。
欧洲列强随后利用这一软弱时刻，讨论如何将一块奥斯曼领土给予俄罗斯……然而，奥斯曼帝国却不被允许参与这些讨论。
[第一次世界大战]但是后来，第一次世界大战爆发了。
突然间，他们所有的主要敌人都开始互相交战。
很明显，奥斯曼帝国正在走向灭亡：其大部分领土被占领，许多重要产业被外国公司所拥有，欧洲人现在正在讨论没有奥斯曼帝国的帝国的解体。
因此，奥斯曼帝国面临一个非常简单的选择：他们要么继续沿着目前的路线前进，成为西方殖民地，就像世界上许多地方一样……或者……他们可以趁着他们最大的敌人卷入战争的时候，抓住机会赶走外国侵略者。
帝国已经灭亡，这是他们拯救帝国的唯一希望。
因此，他们最终在 1914 年底决定加入德国一方的战争，当时德国似乎即将赢得战争……但众所周知……他们选择了失败的一方。
这场战争对于奥斯曼帝国来说是一场灾难，他们唯一的重大胜利是在加里波利保卫伊斯坦布尔。
据估计，奥斯曼士兵死亡人数为 80 万，受伤人数为 40 万至 70 万。
[战后] 战后，战胜国将奥斯曼军队的规模限制在仅仅 50,000 人，重要的铁路被交给欧洲投资者，帝国被各个国家瓜分：英国和法国占领了中东大部分地区；
希腊获得了东部部分领土，这就是为什么今天土耳其海岸外的许多岛屿都属于希腊；
意大利获得西南安纳托利亚；
亚美尼亚获得了其最东北部的领土。
这份和平条约彻底肢解了奥斯曼帝国。
他们被允许统治的唯一领土是伊斯坦布尔及其周边地区……

These were wildly different groups with differentideas, some wanted to abolish the monarchy,some wanted a different monarch, while otherswere anarchists.
But they all had one thing in common: theyall wanted to get rid of the current sultan.
But none of them had enough power to implementtheir ideas onto their homeland.
This changed in 1905 with the Russian revolution.
Firstly it was defeated by Japan, a countrythat 50 years earlier was considered primitivethat could now stand up against the mightyrussian Empire.
Then, the Russian emperor was forced to accepta constitution.
At the same time, Iranians also managed toforce a constitution upon their governmentin 1906 and remove the royal family in 1911.While countries like Italy and Germany managedto unite their people into powerful nations.
If they could do it… why not the Ottomansas well?
And so in 1908 the Young turk revolution succeededin taking over the government.
Their goal was to create a new national identitybased on islam.
You see, with the loss of most of their europeanterritories the percentage of muslims in theempire increased.
Many of those muslims blamed Christians forsiding with Western powers, declaring independence,and causing the decline of the empire.
The young turks wanted to use this resentmentto create a shared islamic national identityin opposition to Western Imperialism.
In the same way Irish national identity wascreated in opposition to the British, or howIndian national identity started in oppositionto the British, or how US national identityfound its roots in opposition to the British.
They hoped that by creating an empire whereall people were equally Ottoman that theycould prevent the disintegration of theircountry.
But the Young Turks couldn’t agree on HOWthis should be achieved: should they centralizepower in Istanbul?
Should they become a federation similar tothe USA?
Should they ask foreign countries to helpthem in their goals?
These disagreements resulted in a counterrevolution in 1909, resulting in Albania declaringits independence.
This showed many within the empire that eventhe Young Turks and their beliefs were unableto prevent the further disintegration of theempire.
This moment of weakness caused Serbia, Bulgaria,Greece, and Montenegro, all of which usedto be part of the empire at one point, declaredwar against the Ottomans.
By the end of that war, the Ottomans had almostno territory left in Europe anymore.
European powers then used this moment of weaknessto discuss how Russia should be given a pieceof Ottoman territory…The Ottomans, however, were not allowed toparticipate in these discussions.
[WW1]But then, WW1 happened.
All of a sudden all their major enemies wereat war with one another.
It was clear the Ottomans Empire was dying:much of their territory was taken over, manyimportant industries were owned by foreigncompanies, and the Europeans were now discussingthe disintegration of the empire without theOttomans present.
And so the Ottoman Empire was given with avery simple choice: they could either keepgoing along their current route and becomea western colony like so much of the worldhad already become…Or…They could take a chance to kick out the foreigninvaders at a time when their greatest enemieswere embroiled in a war.
The empire was already lost and this was theironly hope to save it.
And so they eventually decided to join thewar on the side of Germany at the end of 1914,when it seemed Germany was set to win thewar…But as we all know… they chose the losingside.
The war was a disaster for the Ottomans, withtheir only major victory being the defenseof Istanbul at Gallipoli.
It’s estimated 800.000 Ottoman soldiersdied, with 400-700.000 wounded.
[POST-WAR] After the war the victorious powersrestricted the size of the Ottoman army tojust 50.000 men, important railroads wereput in the hands of European investors, andthe empire was split up between various countries:Great Britain and France would take most ofthe middle east; Greece received parts ofthe eastern territories, which is why todaymany of the islands off the Turkish coastare Greek; Italy received south-west anatolia;and Armenia received their most north-easternterritories.
The peace treaty was a complete and totaldismemberment of the Ottoman Empire.
The only territory they were allowed to rulewas Istanbul and its surrounding areas…

但受到国际监督。
该帝国已成为西欧和南欧国家的一系列殖民地。
你可以想象，当人们得知他们现在处于欧洲占领之下时，他们对此感到非常高兴，并几乎立即组建民兵来抵抗侵略者。
奥斯曼帝国各支军队拒绝放下武器，而是组成一支统一的抵抗外国占领的军队，即民族主义者。
他们取得了多项军事胜利，在土耳其独立战争中击败了希腊和亚美尼亚占领军。
他们并不热衷于恢复帝国，而是寻求解放我们今天所说的土耳其。
第一次世界大战后，法国和英国对再次爆发长期冲突不感兴趣，因此 1922 年 10 月 27 日，欧洲列强邀请国民党政府和奥斯曼帝国政府参加和平会议。
1923年条约签署后，苏丹和奥斯曼帝国政府被解散，新土耳其政府放弃了对奥斯曼帝国先前拥有的土地的主权，土耳其共和国于1923年10月29日正式诞生，奥斯曼帝国就此终结。


but under international supervision.
The empire had become a series of coloniesfor Western and Southern European states.
As you can imagine, the people who were toldthey were now under European occupation werenot very happy about this and almost immediatelyformed militias to fight off the invaders.
Various Ottoman armies refused to lay downtheir weapons and instead formed a unifiedresistance against foreign occupation, knownas the Nationalists.
They achieved various military successes,defeating the Greek and Armenian occupationforces in the Turkish War of Independence.
They were not interested in restoring theempire, rather, they sought to free what wetoday call turkey.
The French and British were not interestedin yet another long conflict right after WW1and so on October 27 1922 the European powersinvited the Nationalist and Ottoman governmentsto attend a peace conference.
When the treaty was signed in 1923, the sultanand the Ottoman government had been dismissed,the new Turkish government renounced theirclaims on lands previously owned by the OttomanEmpire, and the Republic of Turkey was officiallyborn on October 29, 1923.And so ended the Ottoman Empire.
