The canal's sheer size and strategic locationhave made it a vital conduit for world commerce,revolutionizing the shipping industry andshaping the global economy as we know it today.
In this video, we'll delve deeper into thefascinating history, construction, and significance

# The Ancient Suez Canal

。
第一章：古苏伊士运河今天塞得港和苏伊士城之间的水道实际上并不是第一条苏伊士运河。
苏伊士地峡周边地区已有 5000 多年的文明历史，自古代法老以来，人们就一直渴望将地中海与邻近的红海连接起来。
由于 3800 年的历史侵蚀了证据，苏伊士运河第一条前身的路径和时间表的具体细节仍有争议，但人们相信法老运河是第一条连接地中海和红海的人工运河。
大约公元前 1800 年，埃及中王国第十二王朝时期，修建了一条长约100 公里、宽 30 米、深 9 米的运河，连接了今天苦湖周围的红海最北端和尼罗河三角洲的远端。
虽然这条运河已不复存在，但埃及、罗马和希腊古代文献中的记载、运河拟建路线上挖掘出的港口建筑以及现代卫星图像上的清晰迹象，都为它的存在提供了强有力的证据。
红海后退、尼罗河淤泥堆积、恶劣的沙漠条件、缺乏先进的挖掘机械以及沙漠沙子不断填满运河等因素最终意味着运河的存在取决于当前领导人的摆布，大约1500 年后，当罗马人征服埃及时，据说运河已经完全废弃。
公元 600 年左右，当地峡被阿拉伯哈里发占领时，人们曾试图恢复这条运河，但它再也没有恢复昔日的意义。
威尼斯人、奥斯曼人和拿破仑等人都曾尝试重新连接两洋，但这些努力最终均无成果。
在拿破仑对地峡进行勘测运动期间，对该地区的海拔进行了详细的测绘，由于错误地测量红海的高度比地中海高出 8.5 米，因此进一步修建一条从地中海到红海的新南北运河的想法被阻止了。
然而，随着 19 世纪的进步，这种误解得到了纠正，最终导致一群法国和英国的土木工程师承担了这项任务，并最终形成了

of the Suez Canal.
Chapter 1: The Ancient Suez CanalToday’s waterway between Port Said and thecity of Suez was not actually the first SuezCanal.
The surrounding areas of the Isthmus of Suezhave been populated by civilizations for over5000 years now and the idea of connectingthe Mediterranean Sea with the neighbouringRed Sea has been a desire since the ancientPharaohs.
While exact details about the path and timelineof the first precursor of the Suez Canal areup for debate due to 3800 years of historyeroding the evidence, the Canal of the Pharaohsis believed to be the first instance of aman-made connection between the Mediterraneanand Red Sea.
Around 1800 BC, during the 12th Dynasty ofthe Middle Kingdom of Egypt, an approximately100 kilometre long canal, 30 meters wide and 9 metersdeep has been constructed, connectingthe most northern extend of the Red Sea aroundtodays Bitter Lake with a far arm of the NileDelta.
While the canal doesn’t exist anymore, mentionsin Egyptian, Roman and Greek ancient literature,excavated harbour structures at the proposedcourse of the canal and clear indicationson modern satellite imagery are bringing upa strong case in favour of its existence.
Factors such as a receding Red Sea, silt accumulationsin the Nile, harsh desert conditions, lackof advanced excavation machinery, and desertsand continuously filling the canal eventuallymeant that the canal's existence was at themercy of the current leader and after approximately1500 years, when the Romans conquered Egypt,it is said to have fallen to compete disuse.
When the Isthmus was under occupation of anArabic Caliphate around the year 600, an attemptwas made to revive the canal, but it neverregained its former significance.
Many other attempts have been made to reconnectthe Seas, among them the Venetians, the Ottomans,and Napoleon, but none of the efforts endedup bearing fruit.
During Napoleons surveying campaign of theIsthmus, the elevation of the region has beenmapped in detail and further thoughts to builda new North-South canal from the Mediterraneanto the Red Sea have been stopped due to theincorrect measurements that the Red Sea lays8.5 meter higher than the Mediterranean.
As the 19th century progressed, this misconceptionhas been rectified however, which eventuallyled to a group of French and British civilengineers taking up the task which ended up

# The Construction of the Suez Canal

今天的苏伊士运河。
第2 章：建设法国外交官斐迪南·德·雷赛布和当时的埃及人瓦伊德·赛义德帕夏之间的友好关系使得该项目在 19 世纪 50 年代迅速发展，到 1856 年，详细的计划和图纸已经完成，概述了未来苏伊士运河的进程和建设阶段。
尽管英国政府担心，随着陆路航线和绕过合恩角的航线变得不再必要，英国将不再垄断东亚贸易，其影响力将下降，但由13名欧洲土木工程专家组成的小组审查并批准了该报告，为该项目开了绿灯。
1859年4月25日，新建立的塞得港（以埃及统治者的名字命名）的挖掘工作终于开始。
据估计，任何时候都有大约 30,000人同时工作，项目头几年恶劣的劳动条件引发了欧洲投资者越来越多的批评。
五年后，取消了所谓的徭役制度，即要求农民向国家免费提供劳动力的强迫劳动形式，以有偿劳动成为新常态。
此举大大降低了项目工人的死亡率，并使该项目在奠基仪式后仅 10 年就成功竣工。
该项目总共雇佣了来自世界各地的约 150 万名劳工。
由于只配备了镐和铲子，一开始工作进展非常缓慢，但放弃强制劳动后劳动力的短缺导致了一些最先进的发明。
利用蒸汽和燃煤动力的挖掘机和疏浚机，为该项目提供了所需的推动力，仅在过去两年内，大约 100 台重型机械就清除了 75% 的沙子。
经过10年的时间，共计7400万立方米的沙子和岩石被移走，足以填满大盐湖近4倍，1869年11月17日，由几位欧洲贵族组成的就职典礼队伍从塞得港沿运河而下。
在就职典礼期间，狭窄的运河和不均匀的深度已经预示着运河问题会反复出现，一艘船搁浅，在运河中转向

leading to todays Suez Canal.
Chapter 2: The ConstructionFriendly connections between the French DiplomatFerdinand de Lesseps and the then EgyptianWaid Sa'id Pasha led to quick developmentsof the project in the 1850’s and by 1856,detailed plans and drawings have been created,outlining the course and construction phasesof the future Suez Canal.
A group of 13 European civil engineering expertschecked and approved the report, giving agreen light to the project, despite the Britishgovernment fearing a reduction of influencewhen they would no longer hold the monopolyon East Asian trade, as the land route andthe route around Cape Horn would become lessnecessary.
On April 25th, 1859, the excavation worksfinally began at the newly founded Port Said,named after the Egyptian ruler.
It is estimated that at any time, around 30.000people were working in parallel, and horrificlabour conditions in the first few years ofthe project sparked growing criticism amongthe European investors.
After 5 years, the so called corvee system,a form of forced labour where peasants wererequired to provide free labour to the statewas cancelled, leading to paid labour becomingthe new norm.
This step drastically bettered the mortalityrate for workers on the project and led toa successful completion of the project just10 years after the ground-breaking ceremony.
In total, an estimated 1.5 million laborersfrom all over the world were employed on theproject.
Only equipped with pickaxes and shovels, theworks were painfully slow in the beginning, but a shortageof labour after abandonment of forced labourled to some state of the art inventions.
Utilizing steam and coal powered excavatorsand dredgers, gave the project the boost itneeded and a fleet of roughly 100 heavy machineryended up removing 75% of the sand in the last2 years alone.
After 10 years, a total of 74 million m3 ofsand and rock has been removed, enough tofill the great Salt Lake almost 4 times, andon 17 November 1869 an inauguration partyconsisting of several European nobility madetheir way down the canal from Port Said.
During the Inauguration ceremony, the narrowcanal and uneven depth already foreshadoweda reoccurring issue of the canal with oneship running aground, turning in the canal,

第三章 苏伊士运河的历史苏伊士运河建成后起步缓慢，但在随后的几年里，它对世界经济的意义却日益重大。
运河的最大受益者是地中海国家，它们现在有了一条通往亚洲的更快路线，据说这条运河大大增加了欧洲对非洲的殖民。
从一开始，运河的目标就是让所有船只都能通行，无论其来源如何，但在供应线上设置如此狭窄的瓶颈让许多人担心运河周围可能出现动乱。
这种恐惧导致英国于 1882 年入侵运河，并在接下来的 70 年里控制了运河。
20世纪50年代，埃及重新获得了运河的主权，但立即阻止了以色列船只通行，导致了所谓的苏伊士危机，英国、法国和以色列在西奈半岛发动军事行动，以重新控制运河。
在国际政治动荡之后，联军被第一支联合国维和部队取代，但这并不意味着运河作为该地区战争中心的终结。
1967年的六日战争导致运河关闭了整整8年。
1973 年赎罪日战争期间，运河再次成为战争焦点，并最终被交战各方投下的炸弹所覆盖。
在美国扫雷直升机队清理之后，运河于 1975 年重新开放，并最终淡出了国际新闻。
自上次关闭以来，该运河每年平均通行量为 17,000 艘次，仅因几次堵塞才引起人们的关注。
自本世纪初以来，“长赐号”实际上并不是唯一一艘堵塞运河的船只。
2004 年的“热带光辉号”、2006 年的“奥卡尔国王多尔号”、2017 年的“东方海外日本号”以及最终于 2021 年发生的“长赐号”都因各种原因在运河中侧移，堵塞了

and blocking passage for the rest of the party.
Chapter 3: The Suez Canal throughout historyThe completed Suez Canal had a slow startafter its completion but in the followingyears, its significance for the world economyonly increased.
The largest beneficiaries of the canal werethe Mediterranean Countries which now hada way quicker route to Asia, and the connectionis said to have drastically increased theEuropean Colonization of Africa.
From the beginning, the Canal’s goal wasto be accessible by all vessels, regardlessof their origin but having such a narrow chokepoint in a supply line made many people nervousof potential unrests in around the Canal.
This fear led to a British invasion of thecanal in 1882, and the British held controlof the canal for the next 70 years.
In the 1950’s, Egypt regained sovereigntyover the canal but immediately blocked accessto Israeli vessels, leading to the so calledSuez Crisis, in which the British, Frenchand Israeli launched a military operationon the Sinai Peninsular to regain controlof the canal.
After international political tourmoil, thecoalition was replaced by the first UN peacekeepingcorp.
, but this was not the end of the Canalbeing the centre point of war in the region.
The Six-Day war of 1967 led to a total of8 years of closure of the Canal.
During Yom-Kippur war in 1973, the Canal againbecame a focal point of the war effort andended up being littered with bombs from thewar parties.
After they were cleared up by an Americanfleet of minesweeping helicopters, the canalwas reopened in 1975 and finally left theinternational news.
Since the last closure, the Canal saw an averageof 17.000 transits per year and only drewattention due to several blockages.
Since the turn of the century, the Ever Givenwas not actually the only ship blocking thecanal.
The Tropic Brilliance in 2004, the Okal KingDor in 2006, the OOCL Japan in 2017 and finallythe Ever Given in 2021 have drifted sidewaysin the canal for various reasons, blocking

# The Future and Beyond

运河，给世界经济造成了数十亿美元的损失。
第四章：苏伊士运河的今天和未来随着我们进入 21 世纪，苏伊士运河对全球贸易的重要性比以往任何时候都要大。
2022 年是运河开通以来第二繁忙的一年，全球约 12% 的贸易量通过运河运输。
这部分是由于运河历史上最大的现代化项目最近竣工。
苏伊士运河大桥与大苦湖之间的平行航道大大提高了运河的通航能力，并降低了2021年“长赐号”等船只搁浅的潜在影响。
基础设施、交通管理系统和安全措施的持续现代化确保了水道的安全和效率，但尽管进行了这些大规模的投资，苏伊士运河的未来仍不明朗。
沿俄罗斯北部海岸的北极航运路线等替代航线可能成为北欧国家前往中国、韩国和日本的宝贵选择。
2020年该航线累计仅有62趟过境，远未发挥其潜力，但恶劣的天气条件仍让许多物流公司望而却步。
总之，苏伊士运河是人类智慧和决心的证明。
从其古老的起源到其现代的意义，运河塑造了历史的进程，并以以前难以想象的方式连接着世界。
虽然它曾作为冷战战场经历过艰难时期，但无论悬挂何种旗帜，它作为所有船只的航道地位至今仍然存在，作为人类，我们只能希望这一地位永远不会再受到质疑。

the canal and costing billions of dollarsto the world economy.
Chapter 4: The Suez Canal Today and BeyondAs we continue through the 21st century, theSuez Canal has become more important thanever for global trade.
In 2022, the canal has seen its second busiestyear since its inception, seeing around 12%of the entire worlds trade volume floatingthough its waters.
This is partially due to the recent completionof the largest modernization project in thecanal's history.
A parallel shipping lane between the SuezCanal Bridge and the Great Bitter Lake drasticallyincreased the capacity and lowered the potentialimpact of stuck ships such as the Ever Givenin 2021.Continued modernization of infrastructure,traffic management systems, and security measuresensure the safety and efficiency of the waterway,but despite these massive investments, thefuture of the Suez Canal is not certain.
Alternatives such as the Arctic Shipping routealong Russia’s northern coast may becomea valuable alternative for northern Europeancountries on their way to China, South Koreaand Japan.
With a total of only 62 transits in the year2020, this route is still far from its potential,but harsh weather conditions are still scaringmany logistics firms.
In conclusion, the Suez Canal is a testamentto human ingenuity and determination.
From its ancient origins to its modern-daysignificance, the canal has shaped the courseof history and connected the world in wayspreviously unimaginable.
While it had troubling times as a battle groundof the cold war, the status as a shippinglane for all vessels, regardless of theirflag persist to this day, and as humanity,we can only hope that this status will neverbe questioned again.
