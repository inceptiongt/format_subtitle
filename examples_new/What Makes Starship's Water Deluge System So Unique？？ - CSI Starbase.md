# Intro

  （吹口哨）嘿，哟！
下面。
哟，怎么了？
嘿，我这里有你要找的东西。
你就是那个想要建造旧星舰飞机沟槽的人，对吗？
不？
好吧，既然你来了，我无论如何都会向你展示如何去做。
今天，我们将逐步介绍建造大型地下火焰沟的过程。
为了让事情变得更有趣一点，我们将在沼泽中进行。
之后，我们将了解是什么让这个每分钟 250,000 加仑的喷水系统如此独特。
当我们将此与过去 66 年太空探索中其他人所做的事情进行比较时，您可能会想，SpaceX 是如何第一个实现这一目标的？
考虑到这项技术是在太空竞赛开始的同一年获得专利的，很难相信没有人尝试过将其用于此目的。
谁知道呢？
也许他们永远不会。
因为如果我告诉你，与他们为全新星际飞船发射台开发的疯狂系统相比，这实际上是中等水平的天才呢？
是的，你可能想坐下来，因为我们有很多事情要讲。
我叫扎克·戈尔登，这是另一部《CSI 星际基地深度调查》。
（音乐播放）嘿，大家好。
欢迎并感谢您加入我们。
你知道，当谈到开发一种全新的运载火箭时，无论你是一家初创公司还是一家传统的发射提供商，你都

 (Whistling) Hey, yo!
Down here.
Yo, what's up?
Hey, I got that stuff you were looking for right here.
You're the one that wanted to build your old Starship plane trench, right?
No?
Well, since you're here, I'm going to show you how to do it anyways.
Today, we're going to go through the step-by-step process of building a massive subsurface flame trench.
And just to make things a little more interesting, we're going to do it in a swamp.
After that, we're going to learn what makes this 250,000-gallon-per-minute water deluge system so unique.
When we compare this to what everyone else has been doing over the last 66 years of space exploration, you may end up wondering, how is SpaceX the first one to come up with this?
Considering this technology was patented in the same year as the beginning of the space race, it's hard to believe no one else has ever attempted to use it for this purpose.
And who knows?
Maybe they never will.
Because what if I told you that this is actually mid-level genius compared to the insane system that they developed for their brand new Starship launch pad?
Yeah, you might want to sit down, because we've got a lot to cover.
My name is Zack Golden, and this is another CSI Starbase Deep Dive Investigation.
(Music Playing) Hey, everyone.
Welcome, and thanks for joining us.
You know, when it comes to developing a brand new launch vehicle, whether you're a startup company or a legacy launch provider, there's a list of major engineering challenges that you're

# Complex Challlenges

必须在此过程中解决一系列重大的工程挑战。
首先，您需要开发一种发动机以及一种在类似飞行的条件下对其进行测试的可靠方法。
然后，您需要开发可实现快速大规模生产的制造工艺。
通常情况下，您可能必须开发专门针对真空操作进行调整的第二台发动机。
您需要一个第二级运载火箭将有效载荷送入轨道，并需要一个或有时多个第一级助推器来提供将第二级火箭抬离地面并推动其穿过低层大气所需的初始推力。
就像发动机一样，您需要开发用于制造这些车辆并在地面上进行测试的设施和系统。
要测试和发射这些飞行器，您需要一个推进剂储存和分配系统、一种水平或垂直整合飞行器和有效载荷的方法、一个运输系统，当然还有一个发射台。
由于需要应对如此多的复杂工程挑战，而手头的资源又有限，因此寻找一切机会采用现有的解决方案（即经过验证的方法），然后根据您的特定需求以适当的规模进行整合是很自然的。
现在，该视频的重点是水力喷淋系统。
当您考虑开发发射台所需的所有组件时，水喷系统基本上只是整个发射系统中一个小而重要的子组件。
它也恰好是那些极易遵循行业标准并做其他人正在做的事情的领域之一。
当然，每个发射台都会根据飞行器的要求，拥有自己独特的火焰导流板和喷水系统设计。
但实际上将水输送到发射台的方法几乎总是采用以下两种方式之一。
好吧，除非你是 SpaceX。
抛开他们所做的其他很酷的事情不谈，提出创新的喷水灭火系统设计是他们的强项。
他们已经三次在不同场合做过这样的事情了，而最近一次是我所见过的他们想出的最疯狂的想法之一。
但在我们讨论他们为全新星际飞船发射台设计的疯狂系统之前，我们需要了解我们是如何走到这一步的。
这让我们来到了梅西号的试验场，这里是第一条星际飞船火焰沟的所在地。
我原本计划以Massey 试验场演变的简要历史开始这一集，但在撰写摘要的过程中，它最终变成了一整集。
因此，如果您错过了，请务必在这里查看。
现在，在我们开始之前，让我先解决一个显而易见的问题。
我知道你们中的一些人可能会想，等等，SpaceX 不是去年就启用了这个火焰沟吗？
为什么要等到现在才报道呢？
嗯，说实话，这一集已经筹备了大约一年半的时间，并且多次被其他我觉得更具时效性的话题打断。
但在我看来，随着 SpaceX 的第二代星际飞船发射台即将完工，这一点现在变得更加重要。
为了真正理解是什么让它在复杂程度上实现如此巨大的飞跃，我们需要了解之前的重要步骤。


 guaranteed to have to solve along the way.
First, you need to develop an engine and a reliable way of testing it under flight-like conditions.
Then you need to develop the manufacturing process for rapid mass production.
More often than not, you may have to develop a second engine that's specifically tuned for vacuum operations.
You need one second-stage vehicle to get your payload into orbit and one or sometimes multiple first-stage boosters to provide the initial thrust needed to lift the second stage off the ground and propel it through the lower atmosphere.
Just like the engines, you need to develop the facility and systems for manufacturing those vehicles and testing them on the ground.
To test and launch those vehicles, you need a propellant storage and distribution system, a method of horizontally or vertically integrating vehicles and payloads, a transportation system, and, of course, a launch pad.
With so many complex engineering challenges to deal with and a limited amount of resources on hand, it's only natural to look for every opportunity to take existing solutions, a.
k.
a.
tried and true methods, and then integrate them at the proper scale for your specific needs.
Now, the main focus of this video is water deluge systems.
When you think of all the components that go into developing a launch pad, water deluge systems are basically just a small but important subcomponent of the overall launch system.
It also happens to be one of those areas where it's extremely easy to go with the industry standard and just do what everybody else is doing.
Of course, every launch pad is going to have its own unique flame deflector and water deluge system design based on the requirements of the vehicle.
But the method for actually delivering that water to the launch pad is almost always going to be done one of two ways.
Well, unless you're SpaceX.
Ignoring all the other cool stuff they do, coming up with innovative water deluge system designs is kind of their thing.
They've done it on three separate occasions now, and the latest one is on my short list for being one of the wildest ideas I've ever seen them come up with.
But before we can discuss the crazy system they designed for their brand new Starship launch pad, we need to understand how we got here.
And that brings us to the Massey's test site, home of the first of its kind Starship flame trench.
I originally planned to start this episode out with a brief history of the evolution of the Massey's test site, but in the process of writing that summary, it ended up turning into an entire episode.
So if you missed that, make sure to check it out here.
Now, before we get started, let me address the elephant in the room.
I know that some of you may be wondering, wait, didn't SpaceX commission this flame trench last year?
Why wait to cover it now?
Well, to be honest, this episode has been in the works for about a year and a half and has been interrupted on multiple occasions by other topics that I felt were a bit more time sensitive.
But in my opinion, this has become even more relevant now as SpaceX is nearing completion on their second generation Starship launch pad.
In order to truly appreciate what makes it such a massive leap in sophistication, we need to understand the important steps that came before.


# Opera

现在，话虽如此，您可能会想到，经过这么长时间，要跟踪我计划涵盖的所有小细节将极其困难。
嗯，我确实有很多工具可以帮助我保持井然有序，但也许其中最重要的工具是我的互联网浏览器。
多年来，我尝试过几乎所有现有的互联网浏览器。
但自从我发现了 Opera 之后，我就无法想象使用其他任何东西，这就是为什么我很高兴与他们合作制作这一集。
我最喜欢的 Opera 功能之一是标签岛，它允许您将相关的标签分组在一起。
例如，在我为这一集创建的工作区中，我有大量与我一直在研究的不同主题相关的标签。
由于标签太多，当我寻找特定内容时，导航会变得相当困难。
但通过 Opera 的标签岛，我可以将与斯坦尼斯航天中心、卡纳维拉尔角、各种施工过程和设备规格表相关的所有内容分组到各自的标签岛中。
然后，当我在不同主题之间导航时，我可以通过折叠或扩展它们立即使混乱变得有序。
得益于出色的分屏功能，我可以将我的剧集脚本显示在屏幕的一侧，同时将我正在使用的研究网站显示在屏幕的另一侧。
这样就无需使用多个窗口，因为使用多个窗口可能会分散注意力。
如果我在研究各种文章时遇到需要更多信息的内容，我可以使用快捷键来访问免费的内置 AI 工具 ARIA。
ARIA 可以在您的浏览器中快速总结和扩展任何主题。
ARIA 还具有强大的图像识别能力，可以让我上传任何图像并要求它识别对象。
这为我节省了无数的研究时间。
如果您和我一样，那么如果有背景音乐，长时间的工作效率就会更高。
使用内置音乐播放器，我可以从七个不同的流媒体平台（如 Apple Music）中进行选择，并选出我最喜欢的播放列表。
为了在不中断浏览的情况下控制音乐，我可以分离浮动播放器并将其放置在浏览器窗口内部或外部的任何位置。
当我深入制作这些剧集时，这些功能对于帮助我保持思路清晰至关重要。
因此，如果您是那些同时打开 500 个浏览器标签的人之一，那么现在是时候升级了。
点击说明中的链接立即下载 Opera并亲自检查。
好了，好了，让我们开始今天的深入调查。


 Now, with that said, you might expect that it would be extremely difficult to keep track of all of the little details that I've been planning to cover after such a long time.
Well, I certainly have many tools to help me stay organized, but perhaps the most important of those tools is my internet browser.
Over the years, I've gone back and forth using nearly every internet browser in existence.
But since I found Opera, I can't imagine using anything else, which is why I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
One of my favorite Opera features are the tab islands, which allow you to group related tabs together.
For example, in the workspace I created for this episode, I have a huge number of tabs related to different topics I've been researching.
With so many tabs, it can get quite difficult to navigate when I'm looking for something specific.
But with Opera's tab islands, I can take everything related to Stennis Space Center, Cape Canaveral, various construction processes, and equipment spec sheets, and group them all into their own islands.
Then I can instantly bring order to chaos by collapsing or expanding them as I navigate between different topics.
Thanks to the awesome split screen feature, I can keep my episode script displayed on one side of the screen while I have whatever website I'm using for research on the other side.
This eliminates the need for using multiple windows, which can get pretty distracting.
If I encounter something I need additional information on while researching through various articles, I can use a quick keyboard shortcut to access ARIA, the free built-in AI tool.
ARIA swiftly summarizes and expands on any topic right there in your browser.
ARIA also has a powerful image recognition ability, which allows me to upload any image and ask it to identify the object.
This saves me countless hours of research time.
If you're anything like me, then long work sessions are much more productive if I have a soundtrack in the background.
With the built-in music player, I can choose from seven different streaming platforms like Apple Music and bust out my favorite playlists.
To control the music without interrupting my browsing, I can detach the floating player and place it anywhere inside or outside of the browser window.
These features are crucial for helping me stay in the flow while I'm deep in the trenches working on these episodes.
So if you're one of those people who keeps 500 browser tabs open at the same time, then it's time for you to level up.

All right, with that, let's get into today's deep dive investigation.


# Soil Stability Concerns

当负责设计测试和基础设施的团队开始计划将船舶静态点火测试从发射场移开时，他们知道必须采取不同的做法。
现在是时候从这个版本一测试台升级了。
首先，他们再也无法承担从平面上方八米处发射六台极其强大的液体燃料火箭发动机的费用。
这不仅不利于建立一个无需翻新就能处理数百次静态火灾的测试台，而且在这个小型远程测试设施中根本没有足够的空间来 360 度喷出火焰。
因此，他们需要一种可靠的方法来将火焰从车辆上转移开，这意味着他们必须采用某种类型的火焰转向器。
大多数火焰转向器都建在地面以上，并包括一个用于支撑车辆的大型凸起结构。
SpaceX 过去在佛罗里达州 LC39A 的星际飞船试验台原始设计中就已经考虑过这种类型的试验台。
但是，这类高架结构存在很大的后勤问题，因为它们需要大型起重机将车辆吊上和吊下测试台。
这是他们当时已经在做的事情，但他们想摆脱它。
为了满足这一重要的设计约束，他们需要一个地面测试台，这意味着火焰导流板需要位于火焰沟的地下。
他们在麦格雷戈测试中心已经积累了丰富的这方面经验。
但是，在距离内陆 250 英里、粘性土质紧密、自然稳定性高的地方修建地下火焰沟与在这里修建火焰沟有很大不同。
博卡奇卡位于一片低洼的沿海平原，有沼泽、潮滩、沙质土壤，海拔仅略高于海平面，总体而言，它无疑是建造重型工业建筑最不理想的地点之一。
正如 SpaceX 多次发现的那样，如果不进行大量的地基工作来稳定土壤，那么在这里建造的任何建筑物几乎肯定会在以后出现问题。
由于梅西号的试验场完全被水包围，因此面临着独特的挑战。
由于无法对该地点进行岩土工程或地下水调查，我们无法确定地下水位有多深。
但通常情况下，像这样的地区的地下水位极浅，可能仅低于地表三英尺。
在暴雨期间以及涨潮和退潮期间，地下水位深度会发生变化。
这对地下结构来说是一个重大问题，特别是当该结构本质上是一个巨大的空游泳池时。
如果您在土壤水饱和的地区建造地下游泳池，而不采取措施改善地面条件，那么很有可能您有一天醒来时会发现一个相当不愉快的意外。
拥有后院游泳池的人可能对游泳池爆裂现象很熟悉。
如果是这样，希望您通过接受有关如何预防的教育而不是通过个人经验来了解情况。
当地下水的静水压力对泳池外壳施加向上的压力时，就会发生泳池爆裂。
如果水池是空的或部分充满，浮力可以将其抬离地面。
这通常发生在大雨或快速融雪之后。
现在，这种尺寸的火箭的火焰沟显然比一个简单的游泳池要大得多。
但事实上，它是由数千吨混凝土建造而成，但这并不意味着它能够免受静水压力的影响。
正是由于这样的担忧，多年来许多人认为 SpaceX 不可能在星际基地建造火焰沟。
事实上，只要你找到正确的方法，它实际上相当容易实现。
因此，在梅西建造星舰火焰沟的第一步，也是最重要的一步，

 When the teams responsible for designing test and infrastructure began planning to relocate ship static fire testing away from the launch complex, they knew they would have to do things differently.
It was time to level up from this version one test stand.
First and foremost, they could no longer afford to fire six extremely powerful liquid-fueled rocket engines from eight meters above a flat surface.
Not only was this counterproductive towards having a test stand that could handle hundreds of static fires without refurbishment, but there was simply not enough space to be dishing out flames in a 360-degree pattern at this small remote testing facility.
So they needed a reliable way to redirect the flames away from the vehicle, which meant they would have to incorporate some type of flame diverter.
Most flame diverters are constructed above grade and include a large raised structure for supporting the vehicle.
SpaceX had already considered this type of test stand in the past with their original design for the Starship test stand at LC39A in Florida.
But there's a big logistical problem with these types of elevated structures in that they required large cranes to lift the vehicle on and off the test stand.
This was something they were already doing at the time, but wanted to get away from.
To meet this important design constraint, they would need a surface-level test stand, which meant the flame deflector would need to be below grade in a flame trench.
This was something they already had plenty of experience with at their McGregor testing facility.
But building an underground flame trench 250 miles inland in a location with dense cohesive soils and high natural stability is a lot different than building one here.
Situated in a low coastal plain with marshes, tidal flats, sandy soils, and elevations barely above sea level, Boca Chica as a whole is easily one of the least ideal locations for building heavy industrial structures.
As SpaceX has discovered on multiple occasions, if you don't perform a massive amount of groundwork to stabilize the soil, then any structure you build here is pretty much guaranteed to have issues later on.
The Massey's test site in particular presents a unique challenge due to the fact that it's completely surrounded by water.
Without having access to geotechnical or groundwater surveys for the site, we can't say for sure how deep the water table is.
But typically, areas like this have extremely shallow water tables, which can be as little as three feet below the surface.
The depth of the water table can change during periods of heavy rain and also during high and low tides.
This presents a significant problem for subsurface structures, especially if that structure is essentially a gigantic empty swimming pool.
If you build an in-ground swimming pool in an area with water-saturated soils without doing something to mitigate ground conditions, then there's a good chance that you will eventually wake up one day to a rather unpleasant surprise.
Those of you who own a backyard pool may be familiar with the pool pop phenomenon.
If so, hopefully you know what that is from being educated on how to prevent it and not from personal experience.
Pool pop occurs when hydrostatic pressure from groundwater exerts an upward pressure on the shell of the pool.
If the pool is empty or partially filled, the buoyancy force can lift it out of the ground.
This usually happens after heavy rainfalls or rapid snow melt.
Now, a flame trench for a rocket of this size is obviously going to be far more substantial than a simple swimming pool.
But the fact that it's constructed with thousands of tons of concrete does not make it immune to hydrostatic pressure.
Concerns like this are part of the reason why for several years, many people believed it wasn't possible for SpaceX to build a flame trench at Starbase.
In reality, as long as you figure out the right way to do it, it's actually fairly easy to pull off.
So the first and arguably most important step for constructing the

# Deep Soil Mixing

就是稳定土壤。
SpaceX 使用的典型解决方案是使用连续飞行螺旋钻（简称CFA 打桩）来增加必须支撑数百甚至数千吨的结构下方土壤的承重能力。
在梅西号试验场，这些CFA 桩用于建造星舰和助推器低温测试站的基础，以及大型液氧储罐的基础。
这些 CFA 桩不仅有助于提高承载能力，使其超出原生土壤的承受能力，而且还有助于将结构锚固到地面并抵抗上升力。
虽然这无疑是一个可行的解决方案，但它本身并不能消除地下水饱和问题，这在施工过程中仍然是一个问题。
您最不希望发生的事情就是在挖掘过程中地下水渗透过侧壁或渗过沟渠底部。
为了解决这种情况，土木工程师决定采用一种相当常见的地面修复工艺，称为深层土壤混合，简称 DSM。
DSM 是一种在软土中提供沉降控制和增加承载能力的方法。
如果您家里碰巧有这种精神病生物，那么许多人可能都有过亲身经历。
我所指的材料当然是猫砂。
猫砂的主要成分之一是一种叫做膨润土的物质。
膨润土具有吸收水分和液体的能力，是猫砂的理想基材。
当与液体接触时，膨润土可以吸收高达其自身重量 3.5 倍的液体，形成坚硬的团块，然后可以轻松地将其铲起。
当用于土壤修复应用时，膨润土可以形成不透水的硬化土壤层，防止水渗透到挖掘区域。
2023 年 11 月中旬，现场泥浆搅拌厂的设备开始抵达 Massey 的前哨站，同时还有 70 大袋膨润土。
每个袋子重 3,000磅，即 1 1⁄2 吨。
总计超过100吨。
12月初，为期近两个月的将这种膨润土拌入土壤的工作开始了。
让我们看看这个过程是如何进行的。
从混合厂开始，将钠基膨润土大袋与水混合，形成粘稠的泥浆状浆液。
使用旋转钻机，将专用的混合叶片连接到空心旋转方钻杆上。
在竖井的顶部，有一根软管，用于供应从混合厂泵送过来的泥浆。
混合叶片中的装置通过在排出浆料时将其注入气流中来使浆料雾化。
一旦搅拌叶片开始切割土壤，雾化的浆液有助于松动土壤并减少穿透各个层次材料所需的向下的力。
当膨润土在这样的压力下注入时，它实际上会扩散到比柱子的直径更远的地方。
这种注入膨润土的土壤混合物通常被称为土壤混凝土，一旦干燥，它就会起到屏障的作用，防止地下水渗透。
根据 BG45 钻机的配置，我们估计这些土混凝土柱可能延伸到地下 72 英尺深。
这大约距离火焰沟的最终底部 22 英尺。
通常，这些柱子会根据其所支撑的结构的需要，按照某种预定的模式进行钻孔。
在这种情况下，根据我们在行动进行的两个月期间每周进行的 RGV 空中飞越情况，我们能够确定的是，这些柱子似乎覆盖了火焰沟的整个表面积。
这些柱子还延伸到了战壕壁的覆盖范围之外，我们很快就能看到。
虽然很难验证，但我相信他们回去并在每行之间钻了额外的列。
通过重叠柱子，他们有效地创建了一个长 230 英尺、宽 69 英尺、深 72 英尺的巨大土质混凝土块。
好了，现在我们已经完成了初步的地面准备，让我们继续进行实际的火焰沟。
当我浏览上一节中的图像时，您可能已经注意到，火焰沟壁的建造实际上早在深层土壤混合过程完成之前就开始了。
通过重叠这两项操作，他们将这个新测试台的建造时间缩短了近两个月。
如果他们不这样做，发射场的运营就会遭受重大挫折。
正如我在《Massey 的进化》一集中提到的那样，SpaceX依靠这个试验台尽快投入使用，以便他们能够拆除亚轨道试验台并开始建造第二个轨道发射台。
他们只计划使用当前一代的星际飞船执行一定数量的任务，下一代飞船将与原来的发射装置不兼容。
因此，新发射台必须及时准备好，以便第一艘 V3 飞船和助推器能够顺利飞行，这一点至关重要。
为了避免未来发射计划被推迟一年半以上的风险，他们设法通过尽可能重叠各种施工作业的方法来缩短施工时间。
我只能想象，平衡所有这些相互依赖的活动对于项目管理团队来说可能是一场噩梦。
火焰沟北半部的深层土壤搅拌过程完成后，就该

 Starship flame trench at Massey's was to stabilize the soil.
The typical solution that SpaceX uses to increase the load-bearing capacity of the soil beneath structures that have to support hundreds, if not thousands of tons, is to use a pattern of continuous flight auger, or CFA pilings for short.
At the Massey's test site, these CFA pilings were used when constructing the foundation for the Starship and booster cryo testing stations, and also for the massive liquid oxygen storage tanks.
Not only do these CFA piles help increase the load-bearing capacity beyond what the native soil is able to support, but they also help anchor structures into the ground and provide resistance against uplifting forces.
While this would certainly have been a viable solution here, on its own, it doesn't eliminate groundwater saturation, which would still be a problem during the construction process.
The last thing you want is for groundwater to penetrate through the sidewalls or seep up through the floor of the trench during excavation.
To address this situation, civil engineers decided to employ a fairly common ground remediation process known as deep soil mixing, or DSM for short.
DSM is a method of providing settlement control and increasing load-bearing capacity in soft soils.
This process makes use of a material that many of you may have personal experience with if you happen to have one of these psychopathic creatures running around your home.
The material I'm referring to is, of course, kitty litter.
One of the main components of kitty litter is a substance known as bentonite.
Bentonite is the ideal base material for kitty litter because of its ability to absorb moisture and liquid.
When in contact with liquids, bentonite can absorb up to 3.5 times its own weight, causing hard clumps to form, which are then easily scooped up.
When used in soil remediation applications, bentonite can create impermeable layers of hardened soil that will prevent water from penetrating through to the excavation area.
In mid-November of 2023, equipment for the onsite slurry mixing plant began to arrive to the Massey's outpost, along with 70 super sacks of bentonite clay.
Each of these sacks weigh 3,000 pounds, or 1 1⁄2 tons.
That's more than 100 tons total.
At the beginning of December, the nearly two-month-long job of mixing this bentonite into the soil began.
Let's take a look at how this process works.
Starting off at the mixing plant, the super sacks of sodium bentonite are blended with water to create a viscous, mud-like slurry.
Using a rotary drilling rig, a specialized mixing blade is attached to the hollow rotating kelly bar.
At the top of the shaft, there's a hose which supplies the slurry as it's pumped over from the mixing plant.
The mechanism incorporated into the mixing blade atomizes the slurry by injecting it into a flow of air as it's being discharged.
Once the mixing blades begin cutting through the soil, the atomized slurry helps to loosen the soil and reduce the downward force required to penetrate through the various levels of material.
When the bentonite is injected under pressure like this, it will actually spread out further than the diameter of the column.
This bentonite-infused soil mixture is commonly referred to as soil crete, and once dried, it will act as a barrier to prevent groundwater from penetrating through.
Based on the configuration of the BG45 drilling rig, we were able to estimate that these columns of soil crete likely extend up to 72 feet into the ground.
This is roughly 22 feet below the eventual bottom of the flame trench.
Typically, these columns are drilled in some sort of predetermined pattern based on the needs of the structure it will be supporting.
In this case, from what we have been able to determine based on the weekly RGV aerial flyovers during the two-month period that this operation was taking place, it appears that these columns covered the entire surface area of the flame trench.
The columns also extend beyond the footprint of the trench walls, which we will be able to see shortly.
While it's difficult to verify, I believe that they went back and drilled additional columns between each of the rows.
By overlapping the columns, they effectively created a massive 230 foot long, 69 foot wide, and 72 foot deep solid block of soil crete.
All right, now that we've covered the initial ground preparation, let's move on to the actual flame trench.
As you may have noticed while I was going through images from the previous section, the construction for the walls of the flame trench actually began long before the deep soil mixing process was even finished.
By overlapping these two operations, they shaved nearly two months off of the construction time of this new test stand.
Had they not done it this way, it would have been a significant setback for operations at the launch complex.
As I mentioned in the Evolution of Massey's episode, SpaceX was depending on this test stand becoming operational as soon as possible so they could dismantle the suborbital test stands and begin constructing the second orbital launch pad.
They were only planning on flying a set number of missions with the current generation of Starship and the next generation vehicles would not be compatible with the original launch mount.
So it was mission critical for the new launch pad to be ready in time for the first V3 ship and booster flight.
To avoid the risk of causing delays to the launch schedule more than a year and a half in the future, they managed to shorten the construction timeline by finding ways to overlap various construction operations wherever it was possible.
I can only imagine that balancing all of these interdependent activities was probably a nightmare for the project management team.
After the deep soil mixing process was completed on the northern half of the flame trench, it was time to

# Diaphragm Wall Construction

开始建造隔墙了。
这些连续的防水且结构坚固的墙壁通常被称为泥浆墙，是通过挖掘深而窄的沟渠并用钢筋混凝土或泥浆填充而建造的。
它们内置于面板中以确保连续性，并且经常在具有挑战性的土壤条件下或靠近水的地方使用以提供稳定性并防止地下水渗漏。
这些墙有很多用途，但一些更常见的用途是支撑高层建筑的深地下室或地下停车场结构。
您还可以发现它们用于形成大型地下隧道的墙壁，它们通常是大坝建设的关键组成部分，它们充当截水墙以防止水渗入大坝下方或作为溢洪道的结构支撑。
2023 年 12 月 12 日，工人们开始安装第一座导墙的模板。
顾名思义，这些导墙用于保持挖掘工具正确对齐，以确保隔墙以直线建造。
以人类为尺度，你可以看到为墙壁挖出的沟渠实际上相当浅。
它们通常深度约为三到五英尺。
一旦模板就位，就会在两侧浇筑混凝土。
等到其硬化到可接受的程度后，拆除模板，并用泥土暂时填充墙壁之间的空隙。
我认为这只是为了减少人们掉进战壕的可能性。
与此同时，另一支队伍正忙着组装巨大的钢筋笼，这些钢筋笼稍后将用于加固墙壁。
该过程的下一步是开始挖掘比钢筋笼宽度稍宽的墙壁部分。
为此，他们使用液压抓斗挖掘机，也称为抓斗。
抓斗悬挂在起重机上并放入导墙之间以开始移除材料。
为了确保墙壁尽可能笔直，液压抓斗配有转向板，转向板推压导墙以控制其下降时的对齐。
然后，新挖出的沟槽的壁将被用来继续引导工具继续前进。
值得注意的是，沟渠的墙壁位于土溪块的足迹范围内。
正如我之前提到的，这可以防止在移除材料时水渗透到墙壁中。
作为额外的预防措施，在挖掘过程中，将浓稠的膨润土泥浆泵入孔中。
泥浆的密度有助于暂时加固沟槽的壁，防止其坍塌。
如果抓斗能够到达地球较硬的基岩层，那么可以将抓斗挖掘机换成液压铣刨切割工具，直到能够穿透它。
据我所知，这对于这项特定工作来说似乎没有必要，但我认为仍然值得一提。
这样，如果您决定在后院建造其中一个，您就知道如何处理这种特殊情况。
达到所需深度后，如图所示，将端部止动板降低到沟槽底部并靠在两侧的墙壁上。
这些在相邻区域之间形成了平滑的屏障。
接下来，将巨大的钢筋笼小心地放入洞中。
这些笼子大约有 100 英尺长，这意味着墙板延伸到巨大的土溪下方约 32 英尺。
距离战壕底部 40 英尺。
钢筋笼不是放置在孔底，而是用金属梁悬挂，笼子的顶部将保持暴露，以便稍后将额外的钢筋绑入其中，用于地面结构。
一旦固定，混凝土就会被注入洞底。
当浇注较重的混凝土时，它会取代泥浆混合物，而泥浆混合物会不断被吸出，直到只剩下混凝土。
在等待第一块墙板的混凝土变硬时，他们将跳过第二个区域并开始挖掘第三个区域。
这种模式一直持续到他们到达导墙的末端。
此时，第一块和第三块面板的混凝土应该已经硬化到足够的程度，他们可以回来开始建造偶数块面板了。
在挖掘两个已完成面板之间的区域时，重要的是确保在进行下一步之前彻底清洁任一面墙的边缘。
如果有任何土壤粘在墙壁边缘，那么可能会导致面板之间出现缝隙。
这就是我之前提到的那些端部止动板发挥作用的地方。
无需使用抓斗刮擦混凝土墙，端部止动装置会在硬化混凝土和土壤之间形成空隙。
作为额外的好处，端部止动板可以设计成插入挖掘工具的侧面。
这样，当打开翻盖时，它就可以沿着钢梁刮擦，而不是混凝土。
一旦区域完全挖掘完毕，就可以移除末端挡板。
端部止动器的另一个好处是，它们可以设计成像这样的 T 形，这样一旦将其移除，就会在先前完成的面板中间留下一个槽。
因此，当混凝土倒入第二区域时，它将填充两侧的槽并形成互锁面板。
这减少了墙壁被推向沟渠中间的可能性。
此时，我认为墙体周边的土混凝土不再发挥作用，但墙内的砌块将防止水从下方渗出。
虽然 Ryan Hanson 的空间中的这些动画对于可视化这一过程非常有帮助，但如果我们想要更准确，我们会展示深层土壤混合和地下水隔墙施工过程相互重叠。
相反，我们按顺序展示如果 SpaceX不急于完成这项工作，它们将如何建造。
一旦战壕北侧的墙壁完工，就该开始建造火焰战壕

 begin constructing the diaphragm walls.
Commonly referred to as slurry walls, these continuous watertight and structurally robust walls are constructed by excavating a deep, narrow trench and filling it with reinforced concrete or slurry.
They are built in panels to ensure continuity and are often used in challenging soil conditions or near water to provide stability and prevent groundwater seepage.
There are many applications for these walls, but some of the more common usages are for supporting deep basements or underground parking structures for high rise buildings.
You can also find them used to form walls for large underground tunnels, and they are often a key component in the construction of dams where they act as a cutoff wall to prevent water from seeping under the dam or as structural supports for spillways.
On December 12th of 2023, workers began placing the formwork for the first of what are known as guide walls.
As the name implies, these guide walls are used to keep the excavation tool properly aligned to ensure the diaphragm wall is constructed in a straight line.
Using humans for scale, you can see that the trench created for the walls is actually fairly shallow.
They are typically about three to five feet deep.
Once the formwork is in place, concrete is poured on either side.
After it's hardened to an acceptable level, the formwork is removed and the void space between the walls is temporarily filled back in with dirt.
I think this is just to reduce the likelihood of people falling into the trench.
While this was ongoing, another crew was busy assembling the massive rebar cages that would later be used to reinforce the walls.
Next step in the process is to begin excavating sections of the wall slightly wider than the width of the rebar cages.
For this, they use a hydraulic clamshell excavator, which is also referred to as a grab bucket.
The grab bucket is suspended from a crane and lowered between the guide walls to begin removing material.
To ensure the walls are as straight as possible, the hydraulic grab has steering plates, which push against the guide walls to control the alignment as they go down.
The walls of the freshly excavated trench are then used to continue guiding the tool as they progress further.
It's important to note that the walls of the trench are within the footprint of the soil creek block.
As I mentioned before, this prevents water from penetrating through the walls as material is being removed.
As an additional precaution, during the excavation process, a thick bentonite slurry is pumped into the holes.
The density of the slurry helps to temporarily reinforce the walls of the trench to prevent them from collapsing.
If the grab bucket reaches harder bedrock layers of the earth, then the clamshell excavator can be swapped out for a hydro mill cutting tool until they are able to penetrate through it.
From what I can tell, that didn't appear to become necessary for this particular job, but I think it's still worth mentioning.
That way, if you decide to build one of these in your backyard, you know how to handle this particular situation.
After reaching the desired depth, end stop plates, like the ones shown here, are lowered to the bottom of the trench and rest against the walls on either side.
These create a smooth barrier between the adjacent zones.
Next, the massive rebar cages are carefully lowered into the hole.
These cages are roughly 100 feet long, which means the wall panels extend around 32 feet below the massive block of soil creek.
And 40 feet below the eventual floor of the trench.
Instead of allowing the rebar cages to rest at the bottom of the hole, metal beams are used to suspend the cage so the top will remain exposed to allow additional rebar to be tied into it later for the surface level structures.
Once secured, concrete is injected into the bottom of the hole.
As the heavier concrete is being poured, it displaces the slurry mixture, which is continuously sucked out until only concrete remains.
While they wait for the concrete for the first wall panel to harden, they will skip over the second zone and begin excavating the third.
This pattern is continued until they reach the end of the guide wall.
At this point, the concrete for panels one and three should be hardened to a sufficient level, and they can come back and start the even numbered panels.
While excavating the zones between the two completed panels, it's important to make sure that the edges of either wall are completely cleaned before moving on to the next step.
If any soil remains stuck to the edges of the wall, then it could result in gaps between the panels.
This is where those end stop plates that I mentioned previously come into play.
Instead of using the grab bucket to scrape against the concrete walls, the end stops create a void space between the hardened concrete and the soil.
As an added bonus, the end stop plates can be designed to slot into the side of the excavation tool.
That way, when the clamshell is opened, it can scrape along the steel beam instead of the concrete.
Once the zone is fully excavated, the end stop panels can be removed.
Another benefit of the end stops is that they can be designed in a T shape like this one so that once it's removed, it leaves behind a slot down the middle of the previously completed panel.
As a result, when the concrete is poured into zone two, it will fill the slots on either side and create interlocking panels.
This reduces the likelihood of the walls being pushed inwards towards the middle of the trench.
At this point, I think the soil crete outside of the perimeter of the wall is no longer serving a purpose, but the block contained within the walls will prevent water from seeping up from below.
While these animations from Ryan Hanson's Space are extremely helpful for visualizing this process, if we wanted to be more accurate, we would show the deep soil mixing and diaphragm wall construction processes overlapping each other.
Instead, we're showing them in sequential order of how they would have been constructed if SpaceX wasn't in a massive rush to complete this.
As soon as the walls on the northern side of the trench were completed, it was time to begin constructing

# Grade Beams & Roof Platform

的地上部分了。
（轻音乐）二月中旬，大约在项目开始三个月后，工作人员开始在沟渠口处开凿方形开口。
第一步是在嘴巴的位置浇注一个六英寸厚的非加固方形垫。
这通常被称为盲层或工作层，主要用于创建平坦均匀的表面以形成地梁。
正如我之前提到的，您可以看到隔墙的钢筋笼末端穿过工作层，从而使墙体在结构上与地梁连接在一起。
在添加钢筋笼之前，他们必须将所有钢嵌入板放置在混凝土外面，这些嵌入板稍后会暴露在外。
嵌入板用作将附加钢支撑结构焊接到墙上的配合面。
另一种方法是在混凝土硬化后将锚栓钻入混凝土中，但如果可以避免的话，这种方法就不太理想了。
如您所见，开口的每个角落都有四个大嵌入板。
这是静态火架基座稍后要安装的地方。
这里不太显眼的是安装在模板墙一半高度的长嵌入板。
这些后来被用来安装栏杆，当滑动平台延伸到沟渠口时，它会越过栏杆移动。
还有一些额外的板在开口的顶部和底部边缘周围形成边缘。
我们稍后会进一步讨论这些问题。
为安装船用QD型龙门架，在地梁南侧设有四块埋板。
最后，沟槽顶部平台的第一部分有八块嵌入板，我还没弄清楚它们的用途。
一切准备就绪后，他们就可以用混凝土填充这些部分，然后继续挖掘沟渠的其余部分。
对于下一部分，他们建造了剩余的屋顶和沟渠侧壁的地梁。
就像沟渠的入口一样，这始于两面墙顶部的六英寸桩帽。
直到最近我们才意识到一个有趣的细节：沟渠的顶部并不像我们最初认为的那样平坦。
由于钢筋下方有黄色防潮层，您可以看到它在屋顶与墙壁相接的边缘向下倾斜。
这种倾斜的过渡可能是为了减少墙壁和天花板连接处的应力集中，并使力分布更均匀。
它还应有助于促进蒸汽和废气更顺畅地流出沟槽，并最大限度地减少表面的直接冲击和侵蚀。
与屋顶的第一部分一样，有用于延伸平台导轨的嵌入板。
您可以看到方形嵌入物的图案也得到了延伸。
鉴于这些地方从未安装过任何东西，它可能与支撑沟渠的顶部有关。
我确信评论中的某个人会对这里发生的事情有更好的了解。
除了屋顶之外，他们还完成了沟渠出口处墙壁的地梁。
这些木梁有几英尺厚，并有杆子竖起来，以便安装安全栏杆。
另一个值得指出的细节是，沟渠远端没有地下隔墙。
相反，只有表面水平的梁将两侧连接在一起。
这使得以后安装雨水管道变得容易得多。
该项目的这一阶段耗时整整一个月，一旦屋顶梁变得足够坚硬，能够支撑自身的重量，他们终于可以开始挖掘沟槽内部了。


 the above ground portion of the flame trench.
(Soft Music) In mid February, roughly three months after the start of the project, crews began forming the square opening for the mouth of the trench.
The first step was pouring a six inch thick, non-reinforced square pad where the mouth would be.
This is normally referred to as a blinding or working layer and is basically used to create a flat uniform surface for forming out the grade beams.
As I mentioned earlier, you can see the ends of the rebar cage from the diaphragm wall penetrating up through the working layer to allow the walls to be structurally tied into the grade beams.
Before adding the rebar cages, they had to place all of the steel embed plates that would later remain exposed on the outside of the concrete.
Embed plates are used as mating surfaces for welding additional steel support structures onto the wall.
The alternative is drilling anchor bolts into the concrete after it's hardened, which is less ideal if it can be avoided.
As you can see, there are four large embed plates in each corner of the opening.
This is where the pedestals for the static fire stand would later be attached.
Less noticeable here are the long embed plates mounted halfway up the formwork wall.
These were later used for mounting the railing that the sliding platform will move across as it's extended out over the mouth of the trench.
There are additional plates that form a rim around the top and bottom edges of the opening.
We will discuss those more later.
For mounting the ship QD gantry, there are four embed plates on the southern side of the grade beams.
And finally, there are eight embed plates on the first portion of the roof platform of the trench, which I haven't figured out the purpose for yet.
With all of this in place, they were able to fill these sections in with concrete and move on to the rest of the trench.
For this next section, they formed out the remaining roof and the grade beams for the side walls of the trench.
Just like the mouth of the trench, this started off with a six inch pile cap on top of both walls.
An interesting detail that we didn't realize until recently is that the ceiling of the trench is not flat as we initially believed.
Thanks to the yellow vapor barrier underneath the rebar, you can see that it slopes downwards on the edges where the roof meets the wall.
This angled transition is likely intended to reduce stress concentrations at the junction of the wall and ceiling and distribute forces more evenly.
It should also help to promote smoother flow of steam and exhaust gases exiting the trench and minimize direct impingement and erosion of the surfaces.
Just like the first section of the roof, there are embed plates for the guide tracks for the extending platform.
You can see the pattern of square embeds are extended as well.
Given that nothing was ever mounted to these, it may have something to do with supporting the roof of the trench.
I'm sure someone in the comments will have a better idea of what's going on here.
Along with the roof, they also completed the grade beams for the walls along the exit of the trench.
These are several feet thick and have poles sticking up to allow safety rails to be installed.
Another detail worth pointing out is that there is no underground diaphragm wall present at the far end of the trench.
Instead, there is only a surface level grade beam joining the two sides together.
This made it much easier to install deluge piping later on.
It took a full month to complete this phase of the project and once the roof beam hardened enough to be able to support its own weight, they were finally able to begin excavating the inside of the trench.


# Trench Excavation

第一步是将沟槽内壁工作层上的所有混凝土全部挖出。
这包括在沟槽口放置方形垫块，并削去沿着地梁的条带以消除任何悬垂部分。
由于深层土壤混合过程，通往沟渠的坡道比原生土壤稳定得多。
尽管硬化的土壤混凝土可能有点难以挖出，但从好的方面来看，它为挖掘机的行驶创造了一个干燥、稳定的表面。
从沟槽中取出的致密材料也非常适合用作墙壁周围的回填材料。
当我们放大时，你可以很清楚地看到，如果你不知道它来自哪里，块状土壤几乎会被误认为是砾石。
这些废料还被用来建造一条通往沟渠口的车道。
值得一提的是，在建造南半部隔墙的导墙时，坡道下方的区域也经历了相同的深层土壤混合过程。
这是很好的预见，可以防止车道随着时间的推移在 Starship 来回移动的重型测试台的重量下沉。
我确信你们中的一些人现在可能正在家里遇到同样的问题。
无论如何，在到达沟渠底部之前，斜坡会变平，然后逐渐下降到地面。
现在我们可以看到沟渠的最终深度，这让我们真正了解他们建造的这些隔墙有多么深。
正如你所见，设计这个设计的人绝对不是在胡闹。
我不是土木工程师，但我想说，他们可能对此进行了过度设计，以确保绝对不可能将这个超大尺寸的浴缸抬出地面。
挖掘工作完成后，下一步是安装喷水系统的地下管道。
虽然它们不如垫子 A 的增压坐浴盆系统中使用的管道那么大，但它们仍然相当大。
向火焰桶供油的管道有两组，大管道直径为 48 英寸，小管道直径为 30 英寸。
斜坡道修建完成后，在延伸至坡底的沟渠末端的地梁下方挖设涵洞。
用于喷水系统的大型管道被安装在这个涵洞中，然后在我们有机会看到它们之前就被埋了。
还有一根额外的管道用于将水从沟渠中抽出，这里没有显示。
斜坡底部

 The first step to this involved breaking out all of the concrete from the working layer on the inner wall of the trench.
This includes the square pad in the mouth of the trench and shaving down the strip along the grade beams to eliminate any overhang.
Thanks to the deep soil mixing process, the ramp into the trench was far more stable than it would have been with native soil.
Even though the hardened soil crete was probably a bit more difficult to dig out, on the plus side, it created a nice dry, stable surface for the excavators to travel down.
The densified material removed from the trench was also perfect for use as backfill material around the perimeter of the walls.
When we zoom in, you can see pretty clearly that the clumpy soil could almost be confused for gravel if you didn't know where it came from.
The spoils were also used to form a driveway leading up to the mouth of the trench.
I should mention that the area beneath the ramp also went through the same deep soil mixing process while the guide walls for the southern half of the diaphragm walls were being constructed.
This was some good foresight to prevent the driveway from sinking over time under the weight of the heavy duty test stand with Starship on top as they're moving back and forth.
I'm sure some of you out there are probably experiencing that exact problem right now at your house.
Anyway, before reaching the bottom of the trench, the slope flattens out and then steps down to the floor.
Now that we can see the final depth of the trench, it really puts into perspective how insanely deep they constructed these diaphragm walls.
As you can tell, whoever designed this was definitely not messing around.
I'm no civil engineer, but I'd say that they probably over-engineered this just a bit to be absolutely certain that there was no way this super-sized bathtub would be lifted out of the ground.
After the excavation work was finished, the next step was to install underground pipes for the water deluge system.
While not quite as large as the pipe used in the booster bidet system for pad A, these are still pretty damn big.
There are two sets of pipes that supply the flame bucket, with the large pipe being 48 inches in diameter, while the smaller one is 30 inches in diameter.
After the sloped ramp was completed, a culvert was dug underneath the grade beam at the end of the trench extending down to the bottom of the slope.
The large pipes for the water deluge system were installed in this culvert and then buried before we ever had a chance to see them.
There's an additional pipe used for pumping water out of the trench, which is not shown here.


# Ship QD Gantry

采用平坦台阶的部分原因是为了能够完全覆盖大型水管，而不是像其他情况那样伸出地面。
管道安装到位后，他们就可以开始为地板、台阶和出口坡道铺设钢筋了。
您可能已经猜到了，在用混凝土填充之前，在沟槽底部添加了长钉嵌入板。
我们无法看到这个过程，但我们可以相当肯定地说这些是存在的。
我们几分钟后再讨论这个问题。
在火焰沟混凝土施工的同时，其他施工队也在同时建造几个重型钢支撑结构。
让我们快速地讨论一下每一个。
首先是大型移动静态火焰试验台，它允许舰船在火焰沟和巨型舱之间来回运输，从而消除了在试验现场使用起重机的需要。
我在《梅西的进化》一集中已经对该结构的特征做了相当深入的解释。
因此，我们不再在这里重复，而是从船舶QD 龙门架开始。
该结构容纳了通往船舶的所有管道。
所有这些都是在将其抬到腿上之前预先安装在地面上的。
一旦完成，它就会被运送到沟槽，然后被抬到我们几分钟前提到的嵌入板的顶部。
尽快安装这个装置非常重要，以便 GSE 工作人员能够完成油库所有低温和高压气体系统的连接。
当时，我真的希望这个结构能够被屏蔽覆盖，就像发射场低温测试站的 QD 船一样。
但正如我在 Massey 的进化论一集中所说的那样，我认为他们从未想到它会成为必要。
现在回想起来，考虑到 36 号船爆炸后发生的情况，将其描述为重型结构可能有点夸张。
（枪声）事实证明，它远没有看上去那么坚固，但即使有屏蔽，我认为它也不会表现得更好。


 Part of the reason for the flat step at the bottom of the ramp is to allow the large water pipes to be fully covered instead of sticking out of the surface like they would have otherwise.
With the pipes in place, they were able to begin laying out the rebar for the floor, step, and exit ramp.
As you can probably guess, before filling it with concrete, long studded embed plates were added on the floor of the trench.
We weren't able to see this process, but we can say with a decent amount of certainty that these exist.
We will come back to that in a few minutes.
While the concrete work for the flame trench was ongoing, other crews were simultaneously constructing several heavy-duty steel support structures.
Let's quickly touch on each of them.
First up was the large mobile static fire test stand, which eliminated their need for using cranes at the test site by allowing the ship to be transported back and forth between the flame trench and megabay.
I already did a pretty in-depth explanation of the features of the structure in the Evolution of Massey episode.
So instead of repeating that here again, let's start with the ship QD gantry instead.
This structure holds all of the plumbing that is routed to the ship.
All of this was pre-installed on the ground before lifting it on top of the legs.
Once completed, it was carried over to the trench and then lifted on top of the embed plates that we mentioned a few minutes ago.
It was important to get this installed as quickly as possible to allow the GSE crews to finish connecting all of the cryo and high-pressure gas systems from the tank farm.
At the time, I was really hoping this structure would have been covered with shielding, like the ship QD at the cryo testing station at the launch complex.
But as I said in the Massey's Evolution episode, I don't think they ever expected it to become necessary.
In retrospect, it's probably an over-exaggeration to describe this as a heavy-duty structure, given what happened to it after the explosion of ship 36. (Gunshots) As it turns out, it was nowhere near as strong as it appeared, but even with the shielding, I don't think it would have fared any better.


# Sliding Roof Platform

接下来是滑动服务平台，它是静态火灾试验台运行的关键部件，无需使用起重机将船舶吊上吊下试验台。
这个矩形平台相当简单，由两侧各两根工字梁组成，并由八根横梁将它们连接在一起。
周围还安装了较小的方形梁，作为甲板的框架。
在平台的一端，有更高的横梁，用于形成路缘，以防止 SPMT驶过边缘。
结构框架完成后，将波纹地板安装在中心，并用钢筋固定，然后用混凝土填充甲板。
在36 号船事故中，除了少数混凝土破裂而需要更换的区域外，大部分情况都保持得相当好。
幸运的是，只要钢架没有损坏，这种设计就很容易修复。
我们很长时间都无法弄清楚的一件事是用于将平台在沟槽开口处来回移动的机制。
您可以看到，屋顶平台上的栏杆基本上只是一根焊接在钢嵌入条上的方管。
它延伸到沟渠口的两侧，轨道安装在垂直钢板上，顶部有基本上是铁路枕木的东西。
车轮安装在平台底部的轨道上，可能与火车上的车轮类似。
我们无法证实这一点，因为它们是在拍摄这张照片和平台被吊装到位之间的 19 天内安装的。
由于最近发生的一起不幸事件，我们终于能够弄清楚平台是如何在轨道上来回移动的。
我想你可以说这是36 号船爆炸事件带来的一件积极的事情。
在那次事故发生之前，该结构的这个小角落一直被船舶 QD 龙门架和通往屋顶平台的前脚台阶遮挡。
如果不飞过飞船QD 龙门架或直接位于其上方，几乎不可能看到。
直到最近，RGV Aerial 的 Mauricio才尝试这样做，因为河流的形状使​​得从南侧看到风景非常困难，因为这样就有穿越墨西哥的风险。
但经过仔细的穿针引线，他终于拍到了我等待了一年多的完美照片。
因此，多亏了这些极其罕见的角度，我们发现平台两侧安装了两个马达。
正如你所见，它们已被彻底摧毁，但残骸足以让我们将两者联系起来。
通过减少 TFR 限制和升级镜头，Mauricio能够捕捉到安装在平台侧面的横梁的高质量图像。
在这里您可以看到横梁底部有牙齿，这有助于我们最终解开这个谜团。
这是一种典型的齿条和小齿轮机构，您可能会在3D 打印机或自动滑动门上看到它。
从这个角度我们终于应该可以看到轮子了，但不幸的是，它们被某种护板覆盖着。
在平台远端附近，有一个 U 形支架悬挂在安装车轮的底部导轨上。
在小齿轮马达下方，您可以看到一个位于支架上的线性执行器。
一旦平台完全展开在沟槽口上方，该执行器就会通过U 形夹支架上的孔向外延伸，将其锁定到位。
这可以防止SPMT驶上平台时平台滑动。
我怀疑 SPMT 车轮是否真的会移动平台，但在这种情况下，安全总比后悔好。
你知道，尽管这一集晚了一年半，但实际上效果很好，因为它给了我们时间来弄清楚一些较小的细节。
我无法告诉你我多久才在发布一集之后弄清楚一些事情，并且从来没有方便的时间回去并在以后提及它们。


 Next up was the sliding service platform, which is a crucial component for allowing the static fire test stand to be operated without the need for a crane to lift the ship on and off of the test stand.
This rectangular platform is fairly basic, consisting of two I-beams on either side, with eight crossbeams joining them together.
There are also smaller square beams mounted around the perimeter, which act as a form for the deck.
At one end of the platform, there are taller beams used to create a curb to prevent SPMTs from driving over the edge.
Once the frame of the structure was completed, corrugated floor panels were mounted in the center and topped off with rebar before filling the deck with concrete.
This actually held up fairly well for the most part during the ship 36 incident, minus a few areas where the concrete was broken and had to be replaced.
Luckily, the way this is designed allows it to be repaired rather easily, as long as the steel frame isn't damaged.
One thing we were not able to figure out for the longest time was the mechanism used to move the platform back and forth over the opening of the trench.
You can see that the railing on the roof platform is basically just a square tube welded onto steel embed strips.
This is extended on either side of the mouth of the trench, with rails that are mounted to vertical steel plates with what are essentially railroad ties on top.
The wheels are mounted to a rail on the bottom of the platform and are probably similar to ones you might find on a train.
We were never able to verify this because they were installed sometime in the 19 days between when this image was taken and when the platform was lifted into position.
Thanks to a recent unfortunate event, we were finally able to figure out how the platform has moved back and forth across the tracks.
I guess you can say this is one positive thing that came out of the ship 36 explosion.
Before that incident, this little corner of the structure was always hidden from view by the ship QD gantry and the forefoot step down to the roof platform.
Without flying past the ship QD gantry or being directly above it, it's nearly impossible to see.
Until recently, Mauricio from RGV Aerial had never attempted to do this because the shape of the river makes it very difficult to get a view from the south side without risking crossing into Mexico in the process.
But after carefully threading the needle, he was able to capture the perfect shot that I've been waiting for for more than a year.
So thanks to these incredibly rare angles, we discovered two motors mounted on either side of the platform.
As you can see, they were completely obliterated, but the remains were enough for us to put two and two together.
With reduced TFR restrictions and an upgraded lens, Mauricio was able to capture high quality images of the beams mounted to the side of the platform.
Here you can see teeth running along the bottom of the beams, which helped us to finally solve this mystery.
This is a typical rack and pinion mechanism that you might find on a 3D printer or an automatic sliding gate.
We should have finally been able to see the wheels from this angle, but unfortunately, they're covered by some sort of guard plates.
Near the far end of the platform, there was a clevis bracket hanging from the bottom rail where the wheels are mounted.
Below the pinion motor, you can see a linear actuator resting on the bracket.
Once the platform is fully deployed over the mouth of the trench, this actuator extends outwards through the hole in the clevis bracket to lock it into position.
This prevents the platform from slipping while the SPMTs are driving onto it.
I have my doubts that the SPMT wheels would actually shift the platform, but it's better safe than sorry when it comes to that situation.
You know, even though this episode is a year and a half late, it actually kind of worked out well because it gave us time to figure out some of these smaller details.
I can't tell you how often I figure things out after releasing an episode and never have a convenient time to go back and mention them later.


# Flame Bucket Support Cradle

无论如何，在滑动屋顶平台之后，我们终于有了火焰导流斗的支撑框架，该框架是在 SpaceX 的 McGregor 测试设施制造的，然后运往星际基地。
框架的下部支撑着水淋管歧管的弯曲部分。
如您所见，SpeedCore 壁板有四个部分，沿曲线有切口，以便六个 U 形肋条能够插入到位。
对于此应用，SpeedCore 是现浇传统钢筋混凝土剪力墙的更好替代品。
在垂直支架的内部，您可以看到焊接到内壁的螺柱。
它们充当剪力连接件，在钢筋和混凝土之间传递力，以确保墙体作为一个统一的系统。
空心钢框架本身就可以轻松支撑火焰桶，但混凝土填充使其比普通混凝土墙坚固得多，即使不使用钢筋。
除了 Pad A 集成塔的柱子之外，这是 Starbase首次使用 SpeedCore 结构。
但在发现它的用途非常广泛之后，他们很快就开始更频繁地使用它。
当麦格雷戈建造新的垂直猛禽试验台时，他们希望能够并排测试两架猛禽。
他们已经在水平试验台和 2020 年建造的第一个垂直试验台上进行了此项工作。
但我认为这些结构可能无法提供足够的保护来抵御偶尔发生的发动机撞击。
因此这一次，为了保护相邻的测试单元和所有GSE 设备，他们用 SpeedCore 墙建造了收容箱。
现在想想，其实有点好笑的是，麦格雷戈的工程师们在这里为保护 GSE设备付出的努力比在梅西的要多得多。
无论如何，在安装 U 形支撑梁后，在每个肋条的末端之间焊接较小的梁以增加稳定性。
下部支架组装完成后，他们现在准备将其安装在沟槽底部，这将是一次非常有趣的操作。
从上方看，你会发现它比海沟口更长、更宽。
因此，要将这个结构安装到开口处需要相当高的技巧。
使用两台起重机协同工作，将支架倾斜到一侧，然后旋转，以便它能够穿过孔。
一旦它脱离了地梁，它就会向相反的方向旋转，然后倾斜回正确的方向。
在赢得俄罗斯方块锦标赛的最后一个级别后，每个墙壁部分的整个周边都会被焊接到嵌入板上。
为了支撑火焰分流器桶的倾斜部分，有四个三角形的壁靠在沟槽的后壁上。
每个三角形支撑均由四个独立的速度核心部分堆叠并焊接在一起构成。
接下来，将平板焊接到每面墙的正面和背面。
为了清楚起见，在这张图片中它们是仰卧的。
每面墙的顶部都留空，以便他们用水泥填充结构。
最外面的两面墙上安装了四个水平检修平台。
每个楼层之间都有梯子，以便他们检查建筑结构的不同部分。
对于内墙，检修平台是单独组装的。
将每个部分翻转到正确的方向后，三角形框架被逐一抬入沟槽。
其余三个检修平台位于每个三角形墙体部分之间。
一旦将所有这些永久焊接到嵌入板上，上部支架支撑就会安装到支撑墙上。
它们比下部支架部分小得多，因此能够在麦格雷戈完全组装，而不是在现场组装。
但考虑到它们的尺寸，还需要起重机进行串联提升才能将它们穿过沟渠的开口。
我确信将它们通过开口移动到位而不与墙壁和支撑框架相撞是一项相当平衡的动作。
将支架的各个部分焊接到支撑框架上后，他们终于可以用水泥填充速度核心壁了。
这个谜题的最后一个也是最重要的部分是真正的火焰桶，它在被运送到星际基地之前被分成三个巨大的部分建造。
必须重申的是，如果没有麦格雷戈工厂的支持，他们不可能如此迅速地完成这个项目。
我认为现场组装这个很容易就需要额外两个月的时间，这是他们无法承受的。


 Anyway, after the sliding roof platform, we finally have the supporting framework for the flame deflector bucket, which was fabricated at SpaceX's McGregor testing facility before being shipped to Starbase.
The lower part of the frame supports the curved section of the water deluge pipe manifold.
As you can see, there are four SpeedCore wall sections with cutouts along the curve to allow six U-shaped ribs to slot into position.
For this application, SpeedCore is a much better alternative to traditional reinforced concrete shear walls that are cast in place.
On the inside of the vertical brackets, you can see studs welded to the inner walls.
These act as shear connectors, which transfer forces between the steel and concrete to ensure the wall acts as a unified system.
The hollow steel framing would easily be able to support the flame bucket on its own, but the concrete infill makes it far stronger than a normal concrete wall, even without the use of rebar.
Other than the columns of the integration tower for Pad A, this is the first use of SpeedCore structures at Starbase.
But after discovering how incredibly versatile it is, they soon began to use it a lot more often.
When it was time to construct the new vertical Raptor test stands at McGregor, they wanted to allow two Raptors to be tested side by side.
They were already doing this on the horizontal test stand and the first vertical test stand constructed in 2020. But I think these structures may not have been offering enough protection against the occasional engine rug.
So this time around, to protect the adjacent test cells and all of the GSE equipment, they constructed containment boxes out of SpeedCore walls.
Now that I think about it, it's actually kind of funny that the McGregor engineers put a lot more effort into protecting GSE equipment here than they did at Massey's.
Anyway, after the U-shaped support beams were installed, smaller beams were welded between the ends of each of the ribs to increase stability.
With the lower cradle assembly completed, they were now ready to install it at the bottom of the trench, which would have been a very interesting operation to witness.
Looking at it from above, you can see that it's both longer and wider than the mouth of the trench.
So fitting this structure through the opening would have required a fairly decent amount of finesse.
Using two cranes working in tandem, the cradle would need to be tilted to one side and then rotated so it can fit through the hole.
Once it's clear of the grade beams, it's rotated back in the opposite direction and then tilted back to the proper orientation.
After beating the final level of the Tetris Championship, the entire perimeter of each wall section would have been welded down onto the embed plates.
To support the slanted portion of the flame diverter bucket, there are four triangular walls that rest against the rear wall of the trench.
Each of these triangular supports are constructed from four individual speed core sections that are stacked and welded together.
Next, flat panels were welded to the front and backside of each of the walls.
For clarification, these are laying on their backs in this image.
The tops of each wall were left open to allow them to fill the structure with cement.
The two outermost walls have four level access platforms mounted to them.
There are ladders between each level to allow them to inspect different parts of the structure.
For the inner walls, the access platforms were assembled separately.
After flipping each of the sections to the proper orientation, the triangular frames were lifted into the trench one by one.
The three remaining access platforms are located between each of the triangular wall sections.
Once all of this was permanently welded to the embed plates, the upper cradle supports were mounted onto the support walls.
These are much smaller than the lower cradle section, so they were able to be fully assembled at McGregor instead of doing it on site.
But given their size, these also required cranes to perform a tandem lift to get them through the opening of the trench.
I'm sure maneuvering these into place through that opening without colliding with the walls and supporting framework was quite the balancing act.
After welding each section of the cradle to the support framework, they were finally able to fill the speed core walls with cement.
The final and most important piece of the puzzle is the actual flame bucket, which was constructed in three massive sections before being transported to Starbase.
It's important to reiterate that without the support from the McGregor facility, it would not have been possible to pull this project off as quickly as they did.
I think it would have easily taken an additional two months to assemble this on site, which is something they could not afford.


# Flame Bucket Design

2024 年 3 月，三根巨大的管道歧管行程 460 英里到达星际基地。
感谢 Starship Gazer 在他们到达时恰逢其时，出现在了正确的地点，我们才得以看到一些相当令人惊叹的细节。
两个外部歧管部分均由 26 根直径为 8 英寸的管道构成，而中心部分稍小，由 14 根管道构成。
每个部分的底部都有一个供给歧管，上面穿有交替排列的孔。
管道通过孔插入几英寸，然后焊接到歧管的外部。
此后，通过沿整个长度焊接两侧，将每根管道永久地连接到其相邻管道上，以消除可能存在的任何间隙。
每个管道的顶部都有一个螺纹口。
我们最初认为这些可能只是为了清理目的，或者在管道焊接时让气体逸出的通风口。
但考虑到它们上面的塑料盖，很可能后来在这些位置安装了压力传感器或额外的喷嘴。
如果它们存在，这些喷嘴可能与这里显示的喷嘴类似。
较小水歧管的侧面有额外的端口，其中可能也安装了喷嘴。
老实说，我只是不明白为什么这是必要的，所以如果这里发生了其他事情，我不会感到惊讶。
麦格雷戈制造团队留给他们在现场做的一件事就是在管道上钻孔以安装喷水装置。
他们到达后不久，管道上就被涂上了三种颜色的图案，以指示每个部分需要钻孔的密度。
例如，在红色区域中，可能每三英寸有一个孔，蓝色区域可能每两英寸有一个孔，黄色区域可能每一英寸有一个孔。
他们很可能在每根管道上钻了两排孔，以形成重叠的喷雾模式，而不是直接向外喷射。
我可以想象，所有没有油漆的区域要么没有钻孔，要么孔与孔之间的间隔最大，可能有六英寸或更大。
我们很快会再讨论这个问题。
所有孔都打好后，他们终于可以安装火焰桶了。
大约七天后，三部分被抬入沟渠。
首先安装两个侧面部分，然后安装一根管道来连接两个水歧管。
中间部分在后面被降低并位于添加的管道部分的顶部和前面。
为了将铲斗固定到位，将其焊接到支撑架的横梁上。
考虑到他们可能将其安装在12 个 U 形梁的每一侧，因此焊接工作量相当大。
这时这些检修平台就派上用场了，这样他们就可以轻松地爬到需要进行所有焊接的区域。
这也有助于定期维护和检查。
关于铲斗设计需要注意的一个重要细节是，两侧部分由较大的 48 英寸管道供水，而中间部分则连接到较小的 30 英寸管道。
实际上，供应到歧管每个部分的水量是相同的，但考虑到两个外侧部分均有 26 根管道，而中心部分有 14 根，因此两个侧部分中每个管道排出的水量将减少 36%。
这意味着我们预计中间部分的孔数将比两个外部部分的孔数多 156%。
这是有道理的，因为它将有一个 RVAC 和三个中央发动机在其上点火，而侧面部分将各有一个 RVAC。
话虽如此，尽管我们无法看到可见油漆部分的完整图案，但我们仍然可以对它的外观做出合理的猜测。
当我们叠加发动机的位置时，更容易将其想象为基于发动机位置的热图。
确保与各个排气羽流相互作用最大的区域流出更多的水非常重要，这样可以最大限度地增加吸收和散发的热量。
无论如何，在这些部件被吊装到位后不到一周，大概当他们仍在将铲斗焊接到支架上时，26 号船就被推到Massey 公司去调试新的测试台，但它最终会在火焰沟上放置近一个月，直到所有的推进剂分配系统都准备好。
与此同时，他们在沟渠中安装了供水系统的最后一个组件。
为此，他们建造了一个箱子，放置在战壕的左前角。
虽然我们无法确认，但盒子下面很可能有一个小坑，可以收集水并使其膨胀。
该盒子有两个隔间，一个用于放置泵，另一个可能包含过滤系统。
这样，每次测试后，他们就可以将干净的水回收到储水箱中。
我认为，为了使其正常工作，整个沟渠底部必须向前角倾斜。
但即使不是这样，他们每次仍然应该能够排出大部分水。
从开始到结束，火焰沟的建造只用了不到六个月的时间。
如果他们不允许某些操作相互重叠，这项工作很容易就会花费 8到 12 个月的时间。
现在，在我们详细介绍第一种类型的喷水灭火系统之前，让我们先快速回顾一下喷水灭火系统设计的历史。
现在，我不会把重点放在喷淋系统的排放侧，也就是火焰转向器以及雨鸟和水喷嘴的布置上，因为有太多不同的变化，这会花费比它本身更多的时间。
相反，我们将重点关注供水方法，这也是梅西大学这个系统如此独特的原因。
如果你觉得这听起来很无聊，那是因为它确实很无聊。
过去60年来，这个领域并没有太多的创新。
供水系统的基本目标是瞬间向

 In March of 2024, the three gigantic pipe manifolds made the 460 mile trip to Starbase.
And thanks to Starship Gazer being in the right place at the right time as they were arriving, we were able to make out some pretty awesome details.
The two outer manifold sections are both constructed with 26 pipes that are eight inches in diameter, while the centerpiece is a bit smaller and made with 14 pipes.
Each section has a supply manifold at the bottom with a pattern of alternating holes punched through it.
The pipes are inserted several inches through the holes before being welded on the outside of the manifold.
After this, each pipe is permanently attached to its neighbor by welding it on both sides along the entire length to eliminate any gaps that may be present.
At the top of each pipe is a threaded port.
We initially believe these might just be for clean out purposes or vents that allow gas to escape as the pipes are being welded.
But given the plastic caps that are on them, it's possible that pressure sensors or additional nozzles were later installed in these locations.
If they exist, these nozzles would likely be similar to the ones shown here.
There are additional ports on the side of the smaller water manifold that may have nozzles installed in them as well.
Honestly, I just can't see why this would be necessary, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was something else going on here.
One thing the McGregor fabrication team left for them to do on site was drill holes into the pipes for the water jets.
Shortly after they arrived, a three color pattern was painted onto the pipes to indicate the density of holes that needed to be drilled in each section.
For example, in the red areas, you may have one hole every three inches, blue could be every two inches, and yellow might be a one inch separation.
They more than likely drilled two rows of holes on each pipe to create an overlapping spray pattern instead of spraying straight outwards.
I would imagine that all the areas without paint either don't get any holes drilled through them or maybe they have the largest separation between holes, which could be six inches or more.
We will come back to that shortly.
Once all of the holes were completed, they were finally ready to install the flame bucket.
Over a period of about seven days, the three sections were lifted into the trench.
The two side sections were installed first, followed by a pipe to join the two water manifolds.
The middle section was lowered in after and rests on top and in front of the added pipe section.
To secure the bucket in place, it's welded to the beams of the support cradle.
That's quite a lot of welding considering they probably attach it on both sides of each of the 12 U-shaped beams.
This is where those access platforms come in handy so they can easily climb up to the areas where they need to perform all this welding.
It's also helpful for periodic maintenance and inspections.
An important detail to note about the design of the bucket is that the two side sections are supplied by the larger 48-inch pipe while the middle section is connected to the smaller 30-inch pipe.
There will actually be the same volume of water supplied to each section of the manifold, but given that the two outer sections both have 26 pipes while the center section has 14, there will be 36% less water being discharged by each of the pipes in the two side sections.
This means we should expect there to be 156% more holes in the middle section than there are in the two outer sections.
This makes sense considering it will have one RVAC and three center engines firing down on it while the side sections will get one RVAC each.
With that said, even though we weren't able to see the full pattern on the one section where the paint was visible, we can still form a reasonable guess on what it looks like.
When we overlay the position of the engines, it's easier to imagine this as a heat map based on engine position.
It's very important to make sure there is more water coming from the areas that will have the greatest interaction with the individual exhaust plumes in order to maximize the amount of heat that is absorbed and dissipated.
Anyway, less than a week after these were lifted into place and presumably while they were still welding the bucket to the support cradle, Ship 26 was rolled out to Massey's to commission the new test stand, but it would end up sitting on top of the flame trench for nearly a full month until all of the propellant distribution systems were ready.
In the meantime, they installed the final component of the water system in the trench.
For this, they constructed a box to sit in the front left corner of the trench.
Although we can't confirm, there's likely a small pit under the box to allow water to collect and assume.
The box has two compartments, one for a pump and the other may contain a filtration system.
That way after each test, they can recycle clean water back to the storage tanks.
I think for this to work properly, the entire floor of the trench would have to be sloped towards the front corner.
But even if it's not, they should still be able to get most of the water out each time.
From start to finish, the construction of the flame trench took just under six months.
This could have easily been an eight to 12 month job had they not allowed for certain operations to overlap each other.
Now, before we go into detail about the first of its kind water deluge system, let's take a quick historical look at water deluge system design.
Now, I'm not gonna focus on the discharge side of the deluge system, AKA flame diverters and the arrangement of rain birds and water nozzles, because there are so many different variations that it would take more time than it's worth.
Instead, we will focus on the water delivery method, which is what makes this system at Massey so unique.
If that sounds boring to you, that's because it is.
Over the past 60 years, there hasn't been much innovation in this area.
The basic goal of the water supply system is to instantaneously supply massive volumes of water to the

# Industrial Water Pumps

火焰分流器和消声系统供应大量的水。
如果您在街上随便问一个人，他们会用什么在不到一分钟的时间内输送数十万加仑的水，最常见的回答就是大型机械水泵。
这是有道理的，因为大多数市政供水系统都使用工业高流量离心泵或涡轮泵同时为数千个家庭和企业供水。
虽然这可能是水力喷淋系统最不理想的方法，但事实上历史上工业水泵就曾被用于此目的。
最好的例子就是位于密西西比州斯坦尼斯航天中心臭名昭著的 B1 和 B2 试验台。
这些测试台的泵站位于四分之一英里外，毗邻一个容量为 6600 万加仑的水库。
2015 年完成部分升级后，该设施能够通过一条八英尺长的管道每分钟供应 330,000 加仑的水。
想想看，这个水库的容量足以让洪水系统连续运行三个半小时，这有点荒谬。
这意味着您可以在实际排空水库之前连续进行 260秒的静态火力测试。
为了满足这一需求，该设施使用了 13 台高压水泵，这些水泵能够以 300 PSI 的压力每分钟排出超过 33,000 加仑的水。
其对电力的要求同样令人印象深刻。
这些泵由大型 NordbergB16 柴油发动机驱动，您可以在这张图片中看到设施内部的情况。
如果我提到的规格是正确的，那么泵的运行功率约为其最大输出功率的 75%，这对于重型机械来说是相当标准的。
这有助于减少设备磨损，同时增加一点冗余。
话虽如此，我相信您可能可以想象，这是一个运行和维护成本非常高的系统。
除此之外，使用泵驱动系统的一大缺点是可能发生机械故障。
系统越大，发生此类故障的可能性就越大。
为了更好地理解这一点，SLS 的喷水系统以每分钟 900,000 加仑的速度运行。
要使离心泵达到同样的性能，这些泵的总功率需要达到 80 到100,000 马力之间。
因此，如果使用与斯坦尼斯号相同的组件来操作该喷淋系统，则需要34 台泵和发电机，并且设施面积将扩大2.1 倍以上。
发射过程中失去多个泵可能会导致火焰偏转器、发射台其他区域以及有效载荷受损，具体取决于设备的敏感度。
导致此类泵出现机械问题的一个因素是极其强大的火箭发动机产生的振动环境。
这就是为什么大多数使用柴油泵作为喷水系统的设施都将其设置在远离发射台的地方的原因之一。
在卡纳维拉尔角，有多个泵站为各个发射台供水，其中许多已经不再使用。
例如，一号泵站为五号、六号、十七号、十八号和二十六号发射台供水。
SLC-40 和 SLC-41 共用七号泵站，位于两个发射台的中间。
从进入空间站的水歧管来看，它可能有六个柴油驱动的泵，为两个发射台供水。
因此，这仅略低于斯坦尼斯系统尺寸和容量的一半。
由于泵驱动系统的成本和风险，它们不太可能被用作现代喷灌系统的直接水源。
除了我已经提到的那些之外，我发现目前采用这种系统的唯一其他设施是哈萨克斯坦的拜科努尔航天发射场。
我确信印度和中国可能也有一些，但祝你好运找到有关这些信息。
在大多数情况下，业内似乎已经形成了一种不言而喻的共识，大多数发射提供商都认为，如果可以利用重力来输送大量的水，那么使用昂贵的机械泵来输送大量的水是没有意义的，而且成本只是其中的一小部分。


 flame diverter and sound suppression systems.
If you were to ask a random person off the street what they would use to deliver hundreds of thousands of gallons of water in less than a minute, the most common response would be a large mechanical water pump.
And this makes sense, considering a majority of municipal water systems use industrial high flow centrifugal or turbine pumps to supply thousands of homes and businesses at the same time.
While this is probably the least ideal method for a water deluge system, industrial water pumps have in fact been used for this purpose historically.
The best example of this is the infamous B1 and B2 test stands at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.
The pump station for these test stands is located a quarter of a mile away next to a 66 million gallon reservoir.
After some upgrades completed in 2015, this facility has the capability of supplying 330,000 gallons of water per minute through a single eight foot pipe.
When you think about that, the capacity of this reservoir is enough to run the deluge system for three and a half hours straight, which is kind of absurd.
That would mean you can perform 260 second static fire tests back to back before you actually drain the reservoir.
To meet this demand, the facility uses 13 high pressure water pumps, which are capable of discharging more than 33,000 gallons per minute at 300 PSI.
The power requirements for this are equally impressive.
The pumps are driven by massive Nordberg B16 diesel engines, which you can see in this image from inside the facility.
If the specs I mentioned are correct, then the pumps are being operated at around 75% of their maximum output, which is pretty standard for heavy machinery.
This helps to reduce wear on the equipment while simultaneously adding a bit of redundancy.
With that said, as I'm sure you can probably imagine, this is a very expensive system to operate and maintain.
Beyond that, a big downside to using pump driven systems is the potential for mechanical failure.
The likelihood of such a failure is greater with larger systems.
To put that into perspective, the deluge system for SLS operates at 900,000 gallons per minute.
To achieve this same performance with centrifugal pumps, the combined power of those pumps would need to be somewhere between 80 to 100,000 horsepower.
So if you were to operate this deluge system using the same components as Stennis, you would need 34 pumps and generators, and the facility would be more than 2 1 by 2 times larger.
Losing multiple pumps during a launch would likely result in damage to the flame deflector, other areas of the pad, and potentially the payload as well, depending on how sensitive the equipment is.
One factor that can contribute to causing mechanical issues with these types of pumps is the vibration environment created by extremely powerful rocket engines.
This is part of the reason why most facilities that use diesel pumps for their water deluge systems have them located far away from the launch pad.
At Cape Canaveral, there are several pump stations feeding various launch pads, many of which are no longer in use.
For example, pump station one supplied water to launch complexes five, six, 17, 18, and 26. SLC-40 and SLC-41 share pump station seven, located in the middle of the two pads.
By the look of the water manifold entering the station, this likely has six diesel-driven pumps that supply water to both pads.
So this is just under half of the size and capacity of the system at Stennis.
Due to the cost and risk associated with pump-driven systems, they are a lot less likely to be used as direct water sources for modern deluge systems.
Besides the ones I've already mentioned, the only other facility I was able to find that currently employs this type of system is the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
I'm sure there are probably some in India and China as well, but good luck finding information on those.
For the most part, it seems like there is an unspoken consensus that is developed within the industry, and most launch providers have decided that it doesn't make sense to use expensive mechanical pumps to supply massive volumes of water when you can use gravity instead for a fraction of the cost.


# Water Towers

因此，在世界各地的大多数发射场，你都会在发射台附近的某个地方发现一座大型水塔。
在弗吉尼亚州的瓦洛普斯发射中心，你可以在萤火虫阿尔法发射台找到一个。
Rocky Lab 有两座水塔，一座用于电子发射台，另一座全新的水塔用于中子发射台。
阿丽亚娜航天公司在法属圭亚那航天中心的阿丽亚娜 5 号发射台上也安装了一台。
当然，还有卡纳维拉尔角，也就是地球上最繁忙的发射场。
当我为这一集做研究时，我预计会在这里看到比实际发现的更多的水塔。
但我认为这是因为其中一些发射台根本没有使用洪水系统，比如ULA在 Delta IV Heavy 退役前发射它的 LC37 发射台。
我相信如果我错了，评论中一定会有人纠正我，但说实话，我发现这一点还是有点惊讶。
除少数例外，并且不包括2021 年之后的任何情况，所有已知具有雨淋系统的垫子要么使用工业泵站，要么在现场设有水塔。
其中最引人注目的是39B 发射中心。
该水塔是在航天飞机计划开始时安装的，现在正用于 SLS。
39A处有一座相同的水塔，目前仍部分用于猎鹰 9 号的发射。
这些系统由于其简单性而极其可靠，这就是为什么它们成为为喷淋系统供水的最常用方法。
那么让我们快速了解一下它们的工作原理。
以 39B 处的塔为例，有一根大管道从储水箱下来，然后分成几根小管道，分别通向喷淋系统的不同部分。
在塔的底部，主供水管道被分成两半，然后分成两侧三个较小的管道。
每根管道都有一个控制阀，经过控制阀后，管道又汇入两条通往平台的主供水管道。
其中一条管线为火焰转向器顶部的雨鸟和从沟槽侧面伸出的中间立管供水。
该燃料通过移动发射器输送至每个 SRB和主发动机下方的喷嘴。
它们共同形成了一个双层系统，可以抑制噪音并冷却排气羽流。
第二个供给源分布在中间立管两侧的另外两个立管之间。
它们还连接到移动发射器的底部，并为发射甲板上的五个雨鸟喷嘴供油。
这些主要是为了保护移动发射平台的表面，以免升空后被 SRB 熔化。
当他们准备开始向发射台送水时，他们只需打开水塔底部歧管上的阀门。
水的流速由打开的阀门数量控制，因此每侧基本上有三种设置。
当您知道要寻找什么时，您实际上可以看到第二和第三个阀门打开的那一刻。
供应到发射台的水的压力取决于储存容器的高度。
39A 和 B 座塔楼均高 290 英尺。
39A 处的塔最大容量为 300,000 加仑，而39B 处的塔最大容量可容纳近450,000 加仑。
这在一定程度上要归功于塔和储水容器的结构升级，使其能够容纳额外的 150,000 加仑的水。
更大、更强大的火箭需要更多的水来完成相同的任务。
在 SLS 的情况下，所有这些水会在不到 30 秒的时间内释放出来。
令人惊讶的是，这仍然不足以抑制阿尔忒弥斯 1 号任务期间 SRB 产生的巨大过压。
蓝色起源位于 LC36 的新格伦发射台拥有航天工业中最高的水塔，高 351 英尺。
61 英尺的差异又增加了26 PSI，使重力供水系统的静水压力上升到 152PSI，即 10.5 巴。
考虑到 SLS 的推力比新格伦高出近 2.5 倍，我想知道这座塔是否实际上更适合 39B，反之亦然。


 So at most launch sites around the world, you will find a large water tower somewhere within the general vicinity of the launch pad.
At the Wallops Launch Complex in Virginia, you can find one at the Firefly Alpha launch pad.
Rocky Lab has two water towers, one for Electron, and a brand new one for their Neutron launch pad.
Ariane Space has one for its Ariane 5 launch pad at the French Guiana Space Center.
And then of course, there's Cape Canaveral, aka the busiest launch complex on the planet.
As I was doing research for this episode, I expected to see a lot more water towers out here than I actually ended up finding.
But I think this is because some of these launch pads, like LC37, where ULA launched the Delta IV Heavy before it was retired, do not use deluge systems at all.
I'm sure someone in the comments will correct me if I'm wrong, but I was honestly a bit surprised to discover this.
With a few exceptions, and excluding anything that came after 2021, all of the pads that are known to have deluge systems either use industrial pump stations or have a water tower on site.
One of the most notable is Launch Complex 39B.
This water tower was installed at the start of the Space Shuttle program and is now being used for SLS.
There's an identical water tower at 39A, which is still partially being used for Falcon 9 launches.
These systems are extremely reliable due to their simplicity, which is why they are the most common method for supplying water for deluge systems.
So let's take a quick look at how they work.
Using the tower at 39B as an example, there was a single large pipe coming down from the storage tank, which is split into smaller pipes that are routed to different parts of the deluge system.
At the base of the tower, the main supply is split in half and then branches off into three smaller pipes on each side.
Each of these pipes has a control valve, and after the valve, it joins back up into two main supply pipes that run to the pad.
One of these lines supplies the rain birds at the top of the flame diverter and the middle riser that sticks up from the side of the trench.
This is routed through the mobile launcher and feeds the nozzles that are below each of the SRBs and the main engines.
Together, these create a two-tiered system that suppresses sound and cools the exhaust plume.
The second supply split between the other two risers on either side of the middle one.
These also attach to the bottom of the mobile launcher and feed the five rain bird nozzles on the launch deck.
These are primarily meant to protect the surface of the mobile launch platform, so it doesn't get melted by those SRBs after liftoff.
When they're ready to begin sending water to the launch pad, they simply open up the valves on the manifold at the base of the water tower.
The flow rate of water is controlled by the number of valves open, so there are essentially three settings for each side.
When you know what to look for, you can actually see the moment the second and third valves are opened.
The pressure of the water being supplied to the launch pad is determined by the height of the storage vessel.
The towers at 39A and B are both 290 feet tall.
The tower at 39A has a max capacity of 300,000 gallons, while the tower at 39B can hold nearly 450,000 gallons.
This is thanks in part to structural upgrades to the tower and storage vessel to allow it to support the additional 150,000 gallons of water.
Bigger and more powerful rockets require more water to accomplish the same tasks.
In the case of SLS, all of this water is released in less than 30 seconds.
Amazingly, this still wasn't enough to suppress the massive overpressure from the SRBs during the Artemis 1 mission.
Blue Origin's new Glenn launch pad at LC36 features the tallest water tower in the spaceflight industry sitting at a height of 351 feet.
The 61-foot difference adds an additional 26 PSI, bringing the hydrostatic pressure of this gravity-fed system up to 152 PSI, or 10.5 bar.
Considering SLS has nearly 2.5 times more thrust than new Glenn, I wonder if this tower might actually be better suited for 39B and vice versa.


# SpaceX Launch Sites

好的，现在我们知道了其他地方是如何做到这一点的，让我们来看看 SpaceX。
（欢快的音乐）自从2002 年 3 月 SpaceX 成立以来，他们总是想方设法打破常规。
因此，当他们意识到世界上几乎所有的发射提供商都同意运行喷淋系统的最佳方式是使用工业水泵或巨型水塔时，我只能想象对话可能会是这样的。
好吧，水灾似乎很简单。
我们将继续使用现有的系统。
因此，除非有人有要补充的内容，否则我们将继续进行强力GSE 设计审查。
好吧，看，每个人都已经知道我对这种情况的立场了。
我们正在尝试前往火星，好吗？
我们不会追随其他人的脚步。
好的，所以我说，（嘟）那个。
现在让我们集中精力让猎鹰 9 号变得可靠，但最终我们需要对水进行创新。
正如我之前提到的，SpaceX在泰坦IV计划结束后获得的LC-40发射台最初设计采用与LC-41共享的泵驱动系统。
现有系统运行良好，足以让猎鹰 9 号顺利启动，但他们最终会找到一个方便的机会用其他系统来取代它。
（引擎轰鸣）（风声）2016 年 AMOS-6 异常事件发生后不久，发射台上的大部分基础设施遭到损坏，原有系统升级为使用高压气体驱动系统。
据我所知，水仍然由七号泵站供应，但不是直接进入喷淋系统，而是储存在位于发射台附近的四个水平水箱中。
您可以看到水箱后面有几排高压气瓶代替水泵。
为了预充系统，使用如图所示的高压泵将液氮泵入该汽化器。
在此过程中产生的高压气体（压力大概在 2 到3,000 PSI 之间）被储存在气缸组中，直到准备释放为止。
这一过程很可能在发射前几个小时甚至几天发生。
这是一个相当缓慢的气体生成系统。
点火前几秒钟，气体被释放到水箱中，并立即开始通过车辆下方的喷水系统和喷水台两侧的雨水管将水排出。
对于 SpaceX 的第二个运行发射台，即位于范登堡 4 号航天发射中心，其大部分供水系统都是一个谜。
根据埃里克·伯杰在《重返大气层》一书中提到的一个故事，SLC4 的水由远离发射场的工业泵站供应。
但我没能找到它，我想这并不奇怪。
当该地点首次活跃起来时，沟渠内有一个水系统，在点火前几分钟就开始倾倒水。
我认为这是为了在沟渠底部形成一个大水池，发动机一点燃，水池就会立即喷出。
沟槽出口上方有额外的喷嘴，可将水喷入排气羽流中。
对于实际的发射台，有雨鸟喷嘴指向飞行器的底部。
在 2018 年 Iridium Next 4 发射后，他们在背板两侧增加了额外的雨鸟，这些雨鸟会在升空前不久启动。
这些似乎与LC40 的气体动力系统类似，其中储存在高压气瓶中的氮气用于将水从雨鸟伸出的储水箱中挤出。
所以这就像是两个独立的系统合二为一。
SpaceX 的第三个猎鹰 9 号发射场 39A 发射台实际上也有两个独立的系统。
雨鸟由预先存在的水塔供水，但火焰沟上方的喷水系统由机组人员通道塔旁边的一个小型气动系统供水。
老实说，我不确定为什么有必要这么做。
水塔应具有足够的容量来供应这两个系统。
所以这可能与猎鹰重型火箭有关。
2019 年，另一个与 SLC40 尺寸相似的气动驱动系统安装在 39A 发射台，最初计划将其用作第一艘星际飞船试验台。
当然，它从未真正被使用过，最终被拆除并送往星际基地。
在回收了所有可用部件后，他们在第一次综合飞行测试后创建了一个功能更强大的系统版本。
奇怪的是，这里使用的高压气瓶数量明显少于LC40 的系统。
但我真的不知道该如何理解这一点。
无论如何，这样的系统有很多优点。
首先，你不需要一个巨大的水塔。
如果您将来决定升级系统，只需添加更多水箱即可。
如果要提高最大排放压力，可以增加储气系统的容量。
有了水塔，您就必须建造更高的塔来增加静水压力。
由于预充电过程提前数小时甚至数天进行，因此在需要时即可使用。
由于不涉及泵，您不必担心机械部件在运行过程中出现故障。
如果阀门没有打开，你就只能中止发射。
因此，当在马西建造星际飞船试验台时，我们最初预计他们会再次使用相同的系统。
但似乎有人对预充气所有 145 个高压气瓶所需的时间感到非常不满，并且不再有耐心进行该操作。


 All right, so now that we know how this is done everywhere else, let's take a look at SpaceX.
(Upbeat Music) Ever since SpaceX was founded in March of 2002, they have always managed to find ways to break away from the norm in every way possible.
So when they realized that nearly every launch provider in the world agreed that the best way to run a deluge system was by using industrial water pumps or a giant water tower, I can only imagine that the conversation may have gone something like this.
All right, water deluge seems to be pretty straightforward.
We'll just go ahead and use the preexisting system.
So unless anybody has something they'd like to add, we'll go ahead and move on to strongback GSE design review.
All right, look, everybody already knows where I stand on this situation.
We're trying to get to Mars, okay?
And we're not gonna do that by following in the footsteps of anybody else out there.
All right, so I say, (Beep) that.
Let's focus on getting Falcon 9 reliable for now, but eventually we're gonna need to innovate water.
As I mentioned earlier, the LC-40 launch pad, which SpaceX acquired after the end of the Titan IV program, was originally designed with a pump-driven system that was shared with LC-41. The existing system worked fine enough just to get the ball rolling with Falcon 9, but they would eventually wind up with a convenient opportunity to replace it with something else.
(Engine Roaring) (Wind Blowing) Sometime after the AMOS-6 anomaly in 2016, which damaged a lot of the pad infrastructure, the original system was upgraded to use a high-pressure gas-driven system.
As far as I know, the water is still supplied from pump station seven, but instead of going directly to the deluge system, it's stored in four horizontal water tanks located near the pad.
In place of water pumps, you can see several banks of high-pressure gas cylinders behind the water tanks.
To pre-charge the system, liquid nitrogen is pumped through this vaporizer using a high-pressure pump like the one shown here.
The high-pressure gas generated during this process, which is probably somewhere between two and 3,000 PSI, is stored in the cylinder banks until it's ready to be unleashed.
This process likely happens several hours, if not days in advance of the launch.
It's a fairly slow gas generation system.
A few seconds before ignition, the gas is released into the water tanks and immediately begins to force the water out through the deluge system under the vehicle and the rain birds on either side of the pad.
With SpaceX's second operational launch pad, at Space Launch Complex 4 in Vandenberg, most of the water distribution system is a mystery.
According to one of the stories mentioned in the book Re-entry by Eric Berger, SLC4's water is supplied by an industrial pump station located away from the launch complex.
I wasn't able to find it though, which I guess isn't all that surprising.
When the site first became active, there was a water system inside of the trench which began dumping water several minutes before ignition.
I think this is intended to create a large pool of water at the bottom of the trench, which is immediately blasted out as soon as the engines are ignited.
There are additional nozzles above the exit of the trench that spray water down into the exhaust plume.
For the actual launch pad, there are rain bird nozzles pointing at the base of the vehicle.
After the Iridium Next 4 launch in 2018, they added additional rain birds on either side of the strongback, which are activated shortly before liftoff.
These seem to be similar to the gas powered systems at LC40, where nitrogen gas stored in high pressure gas cylinders is used to force water out of the storage tanks that the rain birds are sticking out of.
So this is like two separate systems in one.
SpaceX's third Falcon 9 launch site, Pad 39A, actually has two separate systems as well.
The rain birds are fed by the pre-existing water tower, but the deluge system above the flame trench is supplied by a small gas driven system next to the crew access tower.
Honestly, I'm not sure why this was necessary.
The water tower should have more than enough capacity to supply both systems.
So this might have something to do with Falcon Heavy.
In 2019, another gas driven system, similar in size to the one at SLC40, was installed at Pad 39A for what was originally intended to become the first Starship test stand.
This was never actually used of course, and was eventually removed and sent to Starbase.
After salvaging everything that was usable, they created a much more powerful version of the system after the first integrated flight test.
Oddly, the number of high pressure gas cylinders used here is significantly less than the system at LC40. I'm not really sure what to make of that though.
Anyway, there are many advantages to a system like this.
For one, you don't need a massive water tower.
If you decide to upscale the system in the future, you just add more water tanks.
If you want to increase the maximum discharge pressure, you can increase the capacity of the gas storage system.
With water tower, you would be forced to build a taller tower to increase the hydrostatic pressure.
Since the pre-charge process occurs hours, or maybe even days in advance, it's already available when it's needed.
Because there are no pumps involved, you don't have to worry about mechanical components failing during operation.
If the valve's not open, you simply abort the launch.
So when it was time to construct the Starship test stand at Massy's, we initially expected that they would use the same system again.
But it appears that someone was thoroughly unimpressed with how long it takes to pre-charge all 145 high pressure gas cylinders, and no longer had the patience for that operation.


# Water-heated Cryogenic Gas Generator

这一次，他们想要加入一个可以即时完成的主动气体生成系统。
2024 年 2 月，供水系统的主要部件开始运抵 Massy's。
其中包括三个使用率较低的水箱，每个水箱的容量为 89,400 加仑。
这些确实看起来曾经有过辉煌的时期，但只要稍微刷点油漆就能修复。
水箱旁边是三台相对较小的水泵、一个立式液氮储罐、九个高压储气瓶、四根热交换管。
这些壳管式热交换器用于将热量从一种流体传递到另一种流体，是该系统的关键部件，所以让我们来看看它们。
这些热交换器由六个子组件组成。
首先我们有壳，它是一个圆柱形容器，两端各有两个法兰，以允许水从一侧进入壳并从另一端流出。
壳内有一束平行的管子，它们弯曲并环绕，因此它们在壳的开口端开始和结束。
它们附着在穿孔管板上。
管板夹在壳体和集管之间，其底部有一个入口法兰，顶部有一个用于第二种流体的出口法兰。
在这种情况下，第二种流体将是氮气。
为了分离进出流体，集管中间有一个隔墙，将容器分成两个腔室。
进入下室后，低温液氮被迫通过浸没在温水中的管子。
当液氮流过管道时，水中的热量被传递到液氮中，导致液氮沸腾。
当氮气流过管道时，液体已完全蒸发，并以气体形式从集管的上腔排出。
最后一个组件是穿孔挡板，它们均匀分布在壳体内部。
挡板引导水以锯齿形流过管道，从而增加湍流并提高传热效率。
每个大型水循环低温汽化器的重量都略超过 30,000 磅。
它们比我在网上能找到的任何东西都要大得多，但知道它们的重量可以让我们通过从较小模型的已知规格推断出其性能。
但这以后会变得更加重要。
话虽如此，每个装置每分钟应该能够处理多达 16,000 加仑的水。
液氮由立式储罐供给汽化器。
每个容器顶部排出的氮气被汇入一个公共歧管，然后被引导至水箱下方。
每个水箱旁边都有一个气体分配歧管，它可以将氮气送入水箱或通过通风口排出。
供应到每个储罐的气体被分配到两个直径较小的管道中，然后再重新组合到较大的管道​​中。
其功能类似于我们在水塔示例中讨论的阀门。
还有另一对用于通风口的分流阀。
第一个水箱的排水歧管与火焰桶中部的 30 英寸管道相连。
中间的水箱直接连接到 48英寸的管道，为两个外部部分供水。
最后，最后一个水箱连接到热交换器，为气体生成系统提供工艺用水。
在进水歧管的末端，有一个U形管与出水歧管相连。
这使得部分水可以绕过热交换器。
我们稍后会进一步讨论这个问题。
然后，热交换器排出的水被连接到与中间水箱相同的 48 英寸管道。
在三个排放歧管上，各有一个大的主阀和一个较小的旁通阀，该旁通阀可能仅用于进入火焰桶的管道的初始淹没。
那么这一切是如何运作的呢？
你们中的一些人可能已经根据我对组件的描述弄清楚了一般概念。


 This time around, they wanted to incorporate an active gas generation system that could do it on the fly.
In February of 2024, the main components for the water distribution system began arriving at Massy's.
This included three lightly used water tanks, each with a capacity of 89,400 gallons.
These definitely appear to have seen better days, but nothing a little paint can't fix.
Next to the water tank are three relatively small water pumps, a vertical liquid nitrogen storage tank, nine high pressure gas storage cylinders, and four heat exchanger tubes.
These shell and tube heat exchangers are used to transfer heat from one fluid into another, and are the key component of this system, so let's take a look at them.
There are six subcomponents that make up these heat exchangers.
First we have the shell, which is a cylindrical vessel with two flanges on either end, to allow water to enter the shell from one side and exit through the other.
Inside the shell is a bundle of parallel tubes that bend and loop around, so they start and finish at the open end of the shell.
These are attached to a perforated tube plate.
The tube plate is sandwiched between the shell and the header, which has an inlet flange on the bottom and an outlet flange on the top for the second fluid.
In this case, that second fluid will be nitrogen.
To separate the incoming and outgoing fluid, there is a partition wall in the middle of the header that divides the vessel into two chambers.
After entering the lower chamber, cryogenic liquid nitrogen is forced through the tubes, which are submerged in warm water.
As it passes over the tubes, heat from the water is transferred into the liquid nitrogen, which causes it to boil.
By the time the nitrogen finishes passing through the tubes, the liquid is completely vaporized and exits the upper chamber of the header as a gas.
The final component is the perforated baffle plates, which are evenly spaced out inside of the shell.
The baffles direct the water in a zigzag pattern across the tubes, which increases the turbulence and improves heat transfer efficiency.
Each of these massive water recirculating cryogenic vaporizers weigh just over 30,000 pounds.
These are far larger than anything I was able to find online, but knowing their weight allows us to estimate the performance capabilities by extrapolating from known specifications of smaller models.
But that will become more relevant later.
With that said, each unit should be able to handle up to 16,000 gallons of water per minute.
The liquid nitrogen is supplied to the vaporizers from the vertical storage tank.
And the gas nitrogen discharge from the top of each vessel is combined into a common manifold, which is then routed underneath the water tanks.
Next to each of the water tanks is a gas distribution manifold, which can either send nitrogen up into the tanks or out through the vents.
The gas being supplied to each tank is split between two smaller diameter pipes, which recombine back into a larger pipe.
The function of this is similar to the valves we discussed on the water tower example.
There was another pair of split valves for the vent as well.
The water discharge manifold for the first tank is connected to the 30 inch pipe for the middle section of the flame bucket.
The middle tank is connected directly to the 48 inch pipe, which supplies the two outer sections.
And finally, the last tank is connected to the heat exchangers to supply process water for the gas generation system.
At the end of the water inlet manifold, there's a U-shaped pipe connected to the water outlet manifold.
This allows some of the water to bypass the heat exchanger.
We will discuss that more later.
The water discharge from the heat exchangers is then connected to the same 48 inch pipe as the middle tank.
On each of the three discharge manifolds, there is a large main valve and a smaller bypass valve, which is likely only used for initial flooding of the pipes going into the flame bucket.
So how does all of this work?
Some of you have probably already figured out the general concept based on my description of the components.


# Deluge System Operation

但对于其他人来说，最简单的解释方式就是从头到尾介绍整个过程。
（欢快的音乐）当油罐车到达运送水时，第一个泵用于将油罐车中的水卸载到三个大型储水箱中。
有一个公共歧管连接到所有三个水箱，因此它们同时被充满。
如果一个水箱中的水量较多，那么在注水过程中，它会慢慢与其他水箱中的水量达到平衡。
据我所知，只要水箱中有水，排放管线就会一直被淹没，一直到主阀和旁通阀。
为了帮助启动系统，在喷淋系统启动之前，水箱会预先加压。
为此，他们利用相同的高压氮气供应，将其输送到现场的所有低温储罐和几乎每个气动阀门。
我不会深入解释这一部分，因为我在Massey 的进化一集中已经介绍过了。
该氮气管线与水箱下方较大的气体歧管并排运行。
在分支到每个单独的阀门歧管后，它分成两个较小的管道，连接在第一对红色阀门之后。
此时两组红色阀门都会关闭，因此打开这些微小的黄色阀门后，氮气会慢慢注入罐中，直到达到所需的压力。
这个压力刚好足以启动系统。
现在，回到水泵。
剩下的两个泵从第一个水箱主阀之前的位置抽水。
然后将这些水泵回水箱。
据我所知，这是用来在引入液氮之前通过热交换器循环少量水。
老实说，由于几分钟前我提到过 U 形旁路，我不太确定这是否有效。
似乎没有阀门可以阻止水流过该旁路。
如果没有这个，我怀疑水更有可能通过旁路而不是通过热交换器。
我认为，在这条路径不再是阻力最小的路径之前，可能需要达到某个最低流速。
在系统准备启动之前不久，每个排放歧管上的旁通阀应打开，以允许水开始淹没管道。
他们可能不想提前太久打开它，因为由于罐子距离桶顶有几米远，火焰最终会从火焰桶上的孔中流出。
打开第一个水箱上的旁通阀就足以让水开始在汽化器中循环。
这有点令人困惑，因为我很确定它可以完成与水泵相同的工作，但如果管道直径较大，它可能会更有效。
所以我可能在这里遗漏了一些东西，因为我不明白为什么这些泵是必要的。
无论如何，此后，这些气瓶中储存的高压氮气用于对液氮储罐加压。
这样就无需使用泵来使液氮在线圈中循环。
一旦打开罐体排放侧的隔离阀，液氮就会开始流入每个热交换器。
液氮一进入盘管，就会被热水阀加热而立即开始沸腾。
液氮的膨胀率为 694 比 1，因此这种快速汽化会产生大量的气体。
与您的自然直觉相反，这种扩张不会导致压力增加。
相反，离开汽化器的气体压力将与进入管道的液体压力相同。
这就是为什么保持液氮罐内恒定压力非常重要。
我认为一旦该反应开始，所有三个主水阀都应该打开，并且旁通阀随后将关闭。
从此时起，第一辆坦克将基本驱动整个系统。
随着水流过汽化器回路的速度迅速增加到每分钟约 80,000 加仑，同时液氮流速也应与水成比例增加。
因此该系统能够产生足够的气体来维持水箱内的压力。
我认为这种主动气体生成系统的一个主要好处是它允许他们精确控制流向火焰桶的水流。
对于像 LC39B 这样的重力驱动系统，您只有三种设置：低、中、高，这取决于打开的阀门数量。
在这里，它们有多种方法来控制水流。
为了实现更精确的控制，他们可以调节压力，从而调节进入热交换器的液氮流速，以控制产生的气体量。
通过一些调整，他们可能可以将火焰桶中所需的精确压力调低至 1 PSI 以内。
他们甚至可以通过发动机来控制油门的快慢。
为了快速升高或降低压力，他们可以打开气体排放歧管上的一个、两个或三个安全阀，并且在每个储罐上，他们可以打开一个或两个主供应阀以及一个用于通风口的分流阀。
最后，每个水箱上都有安全阀。
所以总的来说，这就像六种不同的流量设置，但我不确定它们是否真的以这种方式使用。
当他们准备切断系统电源时，我刚才提到的所有减压孔都会打开，以快速释放水箱中的压力，直到可以安全地关闭主排水阀。
最后，在飞船所有六台发动机停止运转几秒钟后，Deutsch 系统才会关闭。
如果我们将其与 A 台的系统进行比较，那么我们可以假设它需要大约 15 秒才能完全停止。
因此，沟渠底部会残留大量的水。
使用火焰桶底部的污水泵，将剩余的水过滤并泵回储水箱。
就像卸货站的泵一样，它可以同时填充所有三个油箱。
当 SpaceX 最终在 2024 年 6 月启用该系统时，当时处于不同完工阶段的所有星际飞船都可以松一口气了，不再需要从平面上方八米处发射六台极其强大的火箭发动机。
通过将羽流从飞船上移开，他们不再需要担心冲击波和碎片反弹到飞船裙部造成的损坏。
同样重要的是，他们现在能够进行更长时间的测试，而不必担心在此过程中损坏混凝土喷砂表面。
也许我最喜欢的是能够在静态点火测试期间清晰地看到车辆的裙部，让我们能够以慢动作观看点火顺序和发动机的运转。


 But for everyone else, the easiest way to explain is to just walk our way through the process from start to finish.
(Upbeat Music) When tankers arrive to deliver water, the first pump is used to offload water from the tankers into the three large storage tanks.
There is a common manifold that connects to all three tanks, so they're all filled at the same time.
If there happens to be more water in one tank, then it will slowly equalize with the others as they're being filled.
As far as I can tell, as long as there is water in the tanks, the discharge lines will be flooded at all times, all the way up to the main and bypass valves.
To help jumpstart the system, the water tanks are pre-pressurized in advance of the deluge system activation.
For this, they tap into the same high-pressure nitrogen supply that's being sent to all of the cryogenic storage tanks and nearly every pneumatic valve on site.
I'm not gonna explain that part in depth because I covered it in the Evolution of Massey's episode.
This nitrogen line runs alongside the larger gas manifold under the water tanks.
After branching off towards each of the individual valve manifolds, it splits into two smaller pipes that are attached after the first pair of red valves.
Both sets of red valves will be closed at this time, so after opening these tiny yellow valves, nitrogen is slowly injected into the tanks until they reach the desired pressure.
This is just enough pressure to kickstart the system.
Now, back to the water pumps.
The two remaining pumps pull water from a location just before the main valve for the first water tank.
This water is then pumped back to the tank.
As best I can tell, this is used to cycle a small amount of water through the heat exchangers before the liquid nitrogen is introduced.
Honestly, I'm not really sure how effective this is because of that U-shaped bypass that I mentioned a few minutes ago.
There doesn't appear to be a valve to prevent the water from flowing through this bypass.
Without that, I suspect the water is more likely to go through the bypass instead of being pulled through the heat exchanger.
I think there's probably some minimum flow rate that has to be achieved before this is no longer the path of least resistance.
Shortly before the system is ready to be activated, the bypass valves on each of the discharge manifolds should open up to allow water to begin flooding the pipes.
They probably don't want to open this up too long in advance because it will eventually start flowing out of the holes in the flame bucket thanks to the fact that the tanks are several meters above the top of the bucket.
Opening the bypass valve on the first tank should be enough to get water to start circulating through the vaporizers.
This is a bit confusing because I'm pretty sure it would accomplish the same job as the water pumps, but it would likely be even more effective given the larger pipe diameter.
So I'm probably missing something here because I don't understand why these pumps are necessary at all.
Anyway, after this, high pressure nitrogen gas stored in these cylinders is used to pressurize the liquid nitrogen storage tank.
This eliminates the need for using pumps to circulate liquid nitrogen through the coils.
Once the isolation valves on the discharge side of the tanks are opened, liquid nitrogen will begin flowing into each of the heat exchangers.
As soon as the liquid nitrogen enters the coil tubes, it will immediately begin to boil as it's heated by the warm water valve.
Liquid nitrogen has a 694 to one expansion ratio, so this rapid vaporization will produce a tremendous amount of gas.
Contrary to your natural intuition, this expansion does not result in an increase in pressure.
Instead, the pressure of the gas leaving the vaporizer will be the same as the pressure of the liquid entering the tubes.
This is why it's important for constant pressure to be maintained in the liquid nitrogen tank.
I think as soon as this reaction begins, all three main water valves should open up and the bypass valves will be closed shortly after.
From this point on, the first tank will essentially be driving the entire system.
As the rate of water being pushed through the vaporizer circuit quickly increases up to an estimated 80,000 gallons per minute, simultaneously, liquid nitrogen flow rate should increase proportionally with the water.
So the system is able to generate enough gas to maintain pressure inside of the water tanks.
I think one major benefit of this active gas generation system is that it allows them to precisely control the flow of water to the flame bucket.
With gravity-driven systems like the one at LC39B, you only have three settings, low, medium, and high, which is determined by the number of valves open.
Here, there are multiple ways for them to control the flow of water.
For more precise control, they can adjust the pressure and therefore the flow rate of liquid nitrogen into the heat exchangers to control the amount of gas being generated.
With a bit of tuning, they can probably dial in the exact pressure they want exiting the flame bucket down to within one PSI.
And they might even be able to throttle it up and down with the engines.
To quickly step the pressure up and down, they can open one, two, or three relief valves on the gas discharge manifold and at each of the tanks, they can open one or both main supply valves and one of the split valves for the vents as well.
And finally, there are relief valves on each of the water tanks.
So in total, that's like six different flow settings, but I'm not sure if they're actually used this way.
When they're ready to de-energize the system, all of the depress vents I just mentioned are opened up to quickly bleed off the pressure in the tanks until it's safe to shut in the main water discharge valves.
Lastly, the Deutsch system shutdown won't occur until a few seconds after all six engines of the ship are no longer firing.
If we compare it to the system at pad A, then we can probably assume that it takes around 15 seconds for it to stop completely.
Because of this, there will be a lot of water left down at the bottom of the trench.
Using the sump pump at the base of the flame bucket, the remaining water is filtered and pumped back to the storage tanks.
Just like the pump at the offloading station, it fills all three tanks at the same time.
When SpaceX finally commissioned this system in June of 2024, all of the starships that were in various stages of completion at the time were able to breathe a collective sigh of relief, no more firing six extremely powerful rocket engines from eight meters above a flat surface.
By redirecting the plume away from the vehicle, they no longer had to worry about damage from shockwaves and debris being rebounded up into the skirt of the ship.
Equally important, they were now able to perform longer duration tests without having to worry about damaging the concrete blast surface in the process.
And perhaps my favorite thing about this was the ability to have clean views looking up into the skirt of the vehicle during static fire tests, allowing us to view the ignition sequence and engine gumbling in slow motion.


# Flame Trench Upgrades

这与亚轨道试验台的操作相比有了巨大的进步，而且将会变得更好。
从2025年1月开始，SpaceX对火焰沟和喷水系统进行了一系列升级。
首先，他们更换了液氮罐，并在原处安装了一个更大的液氮罐。
虽然不知道每个水箱的具体容量，但它似乎比原来的大约大四到五倍。
大约在同一时间，他们还增加了用于给油箱充气的高压气瓶的数量。
如果您曾经好奇过，他们怎么会突然从进行 7 秒静态点火测试转变为进行长达 60 秒的长时间测试，那么，现在您知道了。
原来的液氮罐不够大，无法让他们充分利用三个罐之间储存的水容量。
另一件有趣的事情是，他们有空间容纳五个热交换器，但最终在它与其他热交换器连接之前就将其移除了。
根据最近从该设施南侧拍摄的图像，我们可以看到，在剩下的四个热交换器中，只有三个在流动氮气。
因此，第四个基本上被用作热交换器的旁路，从而将产生的气体总量减少了 25%。
如果我不得不猜测的话，他们可能是在意识到他们在系统初始测试期间产生的气体远远超过需要量后才这样做的。
这个热交换器没有被完全拆除的原因可能是为了保持流向火焰桶外部所需的水流速。
如果每个热交换器每分钟可处理大约 15,000 加仑，而旁通管每分钟只能处理 30,000 加仑，那么完全移除该热交换器将使其处理速度限制在每分钟最多 75,000 加仑。
为了保持每分钟 90,000 加仑的速度，他们需要保留这个速度或增加旁路的尺寸。
我认为他们没有选择这条路线的原因是为了允许他们在必要时快速升级系统的天然气发电能力。
我有一种感觉，当他们开始测试配备升级版 Raptor 3 发动机的车辆时，可能最终需要第四个热交换器来提高系统压力，以匹配V3 船舶 14% 的推力增加。
当他们最终开始在第四版飞船上安装六个 R-VAC 时，他们可能需要全部五个。
推力增加 68%很可能需要对火焰桶外部的整体图案进行一些调整，甚至可能需要提高水容量。
说到升级，2025 年 3 月，在对新的火焰沟进行第五次静态点火测试后，SpaceX 意识到他们可能需要在沟口周围增加一些保护。
尽管排气羽流没有直接接触墙壁，但穿过的火柱也可能是地狱之门。
屋顶平台的混凝土和轨道受到相当强烈的加热。
幸运的是，他们在形成沟槽口时就提前做好了计划，在开口的顶部和底部边缘添加了钢嵌入条。
这样他们就可以轻松地安装保护钢板来覆盖正面和背面所有裸露的混凝土。
在侧面，他们在轨道安装支架上安装了防护罩。
最后，他们在每根铁轨的下方加了一根管道。
就像火焰桶一样，它们上面也有孔，可以向轨道喷水以保持轨道凉爽。
你最不希望发生的事情是，在他们修复因强烈热循环而损坏的栏杆时，船最终被困在试验台上。
您实际上可以在35 号舰的单引擎静态点火测试期间看到这些喷嘴喷射。
这些管道中的每一根都连接到沟槽底部的水歧管上。
我已经等待了一年多的时间，这个风衣又迎来了一次重大升级。
但那件事还没有发生。
尽管喷淋系统似乎确实能很好地冷却废气羽流，但在这些测试中产生的蒸汽仍然非常热。
随着时间的推移，这将导致沟槽裸露的混凝土壁剥落损坏。
经过不到 10 次静态火灾测试后，您已经可以看到混凝土碎片脱落的位置。
我确信我们在这里看到的部分是施工过程中形成的自然表面纹理，但不是全部。
与他们在 2021 年初在集成塔底部安装的防护罩类似，我一直希望这些去年放置在位置一侧的钢板表明他们最终会对火焰沟的墙壁做同样的事情，但这还没有发生。
当谈到减少未来昂贵维修的可能性时，这似乎是可行的方法。
说到昂贵的维修，在新的火焰沟投入使用一年零十三天后，墨菲定律实现了它的诺言，投出了一个没人能预料到的恶魔曲线球。
正如大家现在所知，梅西大学的所有基础设施都不是为抵御这种异常现象而设计的。


 This was a massive improvement from operations at the suborbital test stands and was about to get even better.
Starting in January of 2025, SpaceX made a series of upgrades to the flame trench and water deluge system.
First, they swapped out the liquid nitrogen tank and installed a larger one in its place.
Without knowing the exact capacity of each tank, it appears to be roughly four to five times larger than the original.
Around the same time, they also increased the amount of high pressure gas cylinders used to charge the tank.
If you were ever wondering how all of a sudden they went from performing seven second static fire tests to performing long duration tests that last for up to 60 seconds, well, now you know.
The original liquid nitrogen tank was not big enough to allow them to make use of the full capacity of water stored between the three tanks.
Another interesting thing to note is that they have space for five heat exchangers but ended up removing one before it was ever connected with the others.
And thanks to recent images from the southern side of the facility, we can see that they apparently only have nitrogen running to three out of the four remaining heat exchangers.
So the fourth one is essentially being used as a bypass to the heat exchangers, which reduces the total volume of gas being generated by 25%.
If I had to guess, they probably did this after realizing they were producing way more gas than necessary during the initial test of the system.
The reason this heat exchanger wasn't just removed altogether, likely has something to do with maintaining the desired flow rate of water to the outer sections of the flame bucket.
If each of these heat exchangers can handle roughly 15,000 gallons per minute and the bypass pipe can only handle 30,000 gallons per minute, then completely removing that heat exchanger would limit them to a maximum of 75,000 gallons per minute.
To stay at 90,000 gallons per minute, they would need to leave this in or increase the size of the bypass.
I think the reason they didn't go that route was to allow them to quickly upgrade the gas generation capacity of the system if it becomes necessary.
I have a feeling that when they begin testing vehicles with the upgraded Raptor 3 engines, it may end up needing that fourth heat exchanger to boost the pressure of the system to match the 14% increase in thrust of the V3 ships.
And they will probably need all five when they eventually begin incorporating six R-VACs on the version four ships.
That 68% increase in thrust will more than likely require some adjustment to the whole patterns on the outer sections of the flame bucket, and maybe even an upgrade in water capacity.
Speaking of upgrades, in March of 2025, after their fifth static fire test on the new flame trench, SpaceX realized that they probably needed to add some protection around the mouth of the trench.
Even though the exhaust plume does not directly contact the walls, the column of fire passing through might as well be the gates of hell.
The concrete and tracks for the roof platform are exposed to some pretty intense heating.
Luckily, they planned ahead when forming the mouth of the trench when they added the steel embed strips into the top and bottom edges of the opening.
This allowed them to easily mount protective steel panels to cover all of the exposed concrete on the front and back faces.
On the sides, they installed protective covers on the mounting brackets for the rail track.
Finally, they added a pipe just below each of the rails.
Just like the flame bucket, these have holes punched into them, which spray water towards the rails to keep them cool.
The last thing you would want is for the ship to end up stranded on the test stand while they repair damaged railing resulting from intense thermal cycling.
You can actually see these nozzles spraying during the single engine static fire test of ship 35. Each of these pipes is attached to the water manifolds at the bottom of the trench.
There's another big upgrade to this trench that I've been waiting on for more than a full year.
That still hasn't happened yet.
Even though the deluge system seems to do a really good job of cooling the exhaust plume, the steam produced during these tests is still pretty damn hot.
Over time, this will cause spalling damage to the exposed concrete walls of the trench.
After less than 10 static fire tests, you can already see where chips of concrete have broken free.
I'm sure some of what we're seeing here is the natural surface texture from the construction process, but not all of it.
Similar to the protective shielding they installed at the base of the integration tower in early 2021, I've been hoping that these steel panels sitting on the side of location for the last year were a sign that they would eventually do the same thing for the walls of the flame trench, but that hasn't happened yet.
When it comes to reducing the likelihood of costly repairs in the future, this seems like the way to go.
And speaking of costly repairs, one year and 13 days after the new flame trench was commissioned, Murphy's Law fulfilled its promise by throwing a diabolical curve ball that no one saw coming.
As all of you know by now, none of the infrastructure at Massey's was designed to withstand this type of anomaly.


# Flame Bucket Repairs

在36 号舰爆炸之后，这种火焰桶设计的一个小缺陷变得非常明显。
通过星际之门拍摄的这些图像，我们可以看到，36 号飞船在爆炸时，其几台发动机和整个推力球都碎裂开来，掉进了火焰沟里。
当多台两吨重的发动机撞击火焰桶时，必然会造成一些附带损害。
由于这些火焰桶的组装方式，修理起来并不容易，或者至少不是以最理想的方式进行。
举个例子，假设其中一个 RVAX部分压碎了该区域的其中一根管道。
那么您可能最终需要更换整段管道。
我将把它简化为移除一根管道，因为这样更容易让人理解这一点。
切割此部分时，可以很容易地沿着管道的圆周进行切割，并切割将其固定到支架上的井。
但将它与两个相邻的管道分开时可能会遇到一些问题。
我不确定这些焊接实际上有多深，但在不损坏良好管道的情况下进行干净切割可能很困难。
但我想这取决于你使用什么样的工具来完成它。
您可以将切口偏移到距离焊缝几毫米的地方，然后将剩余的部分全部削掉，但这将是一个相当复杂的过程。
现在，当您添加新的管道部分时，又会出现另一个问题。
再次，您可以轻松地在大部分圆周上进行焊接，但两侧大约有 15度，基本上无法到达。
为了避免这种情况，您必须将整个管道长度一直移除到它连接到歧管之前，以便您可以接触到管道的整个周长。
在我看来，这种方法最有意义，假设您能够将其移除而不会损坏其邻居。
但他们并没有切除整个管道部分，而是只切除了朝上的受损部分。
然后，他们从麦格雷戈连夜送来的备用管道上切下相同的部分，然后用它们来修补从火焰桶上拆下的区域。
老实说，我确信这没问题，但如果不是亲眼所见，我永远不会相信这一点。
通过我们 GV 航拍机的适时拍摄，您实际上可以看到它们执行此操作的过程。
虽然这听起来有点疯狂，但我确信这样进行修复是有原因的。
如果你近距离观察，它可能看起来非常丑陋，但只要它能完成工作，我想这才是最重要的。
好消息是，未来再次发生此类事件的可能性极低。
总的来说，这个喷水系统的设计非常棒，我真的很惊讶以前没有人尝试过这样的东西。
热交换器并不是什么新技术，但据我所知，它们从未以这种方式应用过，这就是为什么这个系统如此独特。
麦格雷戈的 GSE 工程师显然对其性能非常满意，

 In the aftermath of the explosion of Ship 36, one minor flaw of this flame bucket design became painfully clear.
Thanks to these images from Interstellar Gateway, we can see that as it exploded, Ship 36 sharded out several of its engines and the entire thrust puck into the flame trench.
When multiple two ton engines impact the flame bucket, it's bound to cause some collateral damage.
Because of the way these flame buckets are assembled, it's not very easy to make repairs, or at least not in the most ideal fashion.
As an example, let's say that one of the RVAX partially crushes one of the pipes in this area.
Then you would probably end up needing to replace this entire section of pipes.
I'm gonna simplify this down to removing a single pipe because that makes it a bit easier to get the point across.
When cutting this section out, it's easy enough to make cuts along the circumference of the pipes and to cut the wells that secure it to the cradle supports.
But separating it from the two adjacent pipes is where you might run into some problems.
I'm not sure how deep these welds actually go, but it might be difficult to make a clean cut without damaging the good pipe.
But I guess that depends on what kind of tool you use to do it.
You could offset the cut a few millimeters away from the weld and then shave down everything that's remaining afterwards, but that would be quite the process.
Now when you go to add in the new pipe section, there's another problem.
Once again, you can easily perform the weld around most of the circumference, but there's about 15 degrees on either side where it's basically impossible to reach.
To avoid this, you would have to remove the entire length of the pipe all the way down to just before where it connects to the manifold, in a location where you can access the full circumference of the pipe.
In my opinion, this method makes the most sense assuming you're able to remove it without damaging its neighbors.
But instead of cutting out the full pipe sections, they cut out just the parts that were actually damaged on the upward facing side.
Then they cut identical sections out of spare pipes that were overnighted from McGregor, and then used them to patch the areas that were removed from the flame bucket.
Honestly, I'm sure it's fine, but I never would have believed this if I didn't see it with my own eyes.
You can actually see them in the process of doing this thanks to a well-timed shot from our GV aerial.
While this sounds kind of crazy, I'm sure there's a reason the repairs were done this way.
It might look super ugly if you saw it up close, but as long as it gets the job done, I guess that's all that matters.
The good news is, the chances of a repeat incident happening in the future are incredibly low.
Overall, the design of this water deluge system is pretty awesome, and I'm honestly surprised that no one has ever attempted something like this before.
Heat exchangers aren't exactly new technology, but as far as I know, they have never been applied in this way, which is why this system is so unique.
Clearly happy with its performance, the GSE engineers at McGregor

# Water Deluge Museum

决定将该系统用于自己，这并不奇怪，因为他们是该系统的最初设计者。
麦格雷戈测试设施就像一座洪水博物馆。
猎鹰9号试验台和三脚架共用一个水塔，猎鹰9号第二阶段试验台也有自己的水塔。
梅林试验台有一个大型水池，配有用于填充垂直储罐的泵。
它们要么使用重力，要么使用气体注入来为火焰桶提供燃料，但很难说。
水平猛禽试验台是一个谜，但垂直试验台使用水平罐和高压气瓶。
最后，当 SpaceX 于 2024 年 7 月开始建造两个全新的垂直猛禽试验台时，两个火焰沟都配备了与为 Masseys 开发的系统几乎相同的系统。
Raptor 试验台的沟槽更深，火焰桶也更高一些。
唯一的区别是，这些是单引擎测试，因此不需要那么多水。


 decided that they wanted this system for themselves, which isn't surprising considering they were the ones who designed it in the first place.
The McGregor testing facility is like a water deluge museum.
The Falcon 9 test stand and tripod stand both share a water tower, and the Falcon 9 Stage 2 test stand has its own water tower as well.
The Merlin test stand has a large pool with pumps for filling vertical storage tanks.
These either use gravity or gas injection to supply the flame bucket, but it's difficult to tell.
The horizontal Raptor stand is a mystery, but the vertical test stand uses a horizontal tank and high-pressure gas cylinders.
And finally, when SpaceX began constructing two brand new vertical Raptor test stands in July of 2024, both flame trenches were outfitted with near-identical systems as the one developed for Masseys.
The trenches for the Raptor test stand are much deeper, and the flame buckets are a bit taller as well.
The only difference is that these are single-engine tests, so they don't need as much water.


# Outro

因此，该系统缩小到使用单个汽化器而不是三个。
由于 Masseys 的系统似乎是其其他测试台的概念证明，我们预计它可能会被复制并扩大到Starbase 的新版本 2 发射台。
但事实证明，SpaceX另有更大胆的计划。
如果我不得不猜测的话，Raptor Propulsions 团队中的某个人决定转向 GSE 工程，因为为零阶段 2.0 设计的新系统绝对是荒谬的。
我非常怀疑它是否能被其他人构想出来。
在下一次深入调查中，我们将了解星际飞船火焰沟的下一次演变，SpaceX显然已经开始使用小型猛禽

 Because of that, this system is scaled down to use a single vaporizer instead of three.
Since the system at Masseys seemed to be a proof of concept for their other test stands, we expected that it would likely be duplicated and scaled up for the new version 2 launch pad at Starbase.
But as it turns out, SpaceX had something way more aggressive up their sleeves.
If I had to guess, someone from the Raptor Propulsions team decided to switch over to GSE engineering because the new system designed for stage zero 2.0 is absolutely ridiculous.
I highly doubt it could have been conceived by anyone else.
On the next deep dive investigation, we will take a look at the next evolution of Starship flame trenches, where SpaceX has apparently graduated to using baby Raptor
